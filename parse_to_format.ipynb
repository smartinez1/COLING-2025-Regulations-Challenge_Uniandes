Executive Summary  \\nReasons for publication  \\nThe revised AIFMD and UCITS  Directive1 provide that ESMA shall develop guidelines on \\nthe selection and calibration of liquidity management tools (LMTs) by UCITS and AIFMs  of \\nopen -ended AIFs  for liquidity risk management and for mitigating financial stability risks. \\nThose guidelines shall recognise that the primary responsibility for liquidity risk \\nmanagement remains with the UCITS and AIFM. Furthermore, they shall include  indications \\nas to the circumstances in which side pockets  can be activated  and allow adequate time for \\nadaptation before they apply, in particular for existing UCITS and open -ended AIFs.  \\nThis Consultation Paper (CP) represents the first stage in the development of the guidelines \\nand sets out proposals for their content on which ESMA is seeking the views of external \\nstakeholders.    \\nContents  \\nSection 2 explains the background to our proposals and outlines its legislative basis. Annex \\nIII details ESMA’s initial Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) concerning the draft Guidelines. At all \\nstages stakeholders’ input is sought through specific questions, which are summarised in \\nAnnex I.  Annex I V contains the full text of the draft guidelines.  \\nNext Steps  \\nESMA will consider the feedback it received to this consultation and expects to publish a \\nfinal report  by 16 April 2025 . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Directive (EU) 2024/927 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13  March 2024 amending Directives  2011/61/EU \\nand 2009/65/EC as regards delegation arrangements, liquidity risk management, supervisory reporting, the provision of \\ndepositary and custody services and loan origination by alternative investment funds (europa.eu)   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n2. Background  \\n5. Directive (EU) 2024/9272 (hereafter to as ‘the amending Directive’) amending \\nDirectives 2011/61/EU (AIFMD) and 2009/65/EC (UCITS Directive) was published in \\nthe Official Journal on 25 March 2024.  This amending Directive modifies the AIFMD \\nand the UCITS Directive in the area of, inter alia , LMTs, supervisory reporting and \\ndepositaries.  It also amends the AIFMD in relation to loan -originating alternative \\ninvestment funds.   \\n6. The amending  Directive   provide that , by 16 April 2025,  ESMA shall develop guidelines \\n(“the Guidelines”) on the selection and calibration of LMTs  by UCITS and AIFMs of \\nopen -ended AIFs for liquidity risk management and for mitigating financial stability \\nrisks. Those guidelines shall recognise that the primary responsibility for liquidity risk \\nmanagement remains with UCITS and the AIFM. Furthermore, they shall include \\nindications as to the circumstances in which side pockets can be activated and allow \\nadequate ti me for adaptation before they apply, in particular for existing UCITS and \\nAIFs.  \\n7. In that context, ESMA shall, by 16 April 2025, also develop draft RTS to specify the \\ncharacteristics of the LMTs under Article 16(2)(g) of AIFMD and 18a(3) of the UCITS \\nDirective. The future RTS on the characteristics of LMTs will have to be read in \\nconjunction with the Guidelines.  \\n8. Article 18a (2) of the revised UCITSD and Article 16 (2b) of the revised AIFMD state \\nthat a UCITS and an AIFM shall select at least two appropriate LMTs  from those \\nreferred to in Annex IIA, point 2 to 8 , of the  UCITSD and in Annex V, points 2 to 8 , of \\nthe AIFMD, after assessing the suitability of those tools in relation to the pursued \\ninvestment strategy, the liquidity profile and the redemption policy of the fund. The \\nsame Articles state that “the UCITS and the AIFM shall include those tools in the \\nUCITS/ AIF rules or instruments of incorporation for possible use in the interest of the  \\nUCITS’/ AIF’s investors ” and that “ it shall not be possible for that selection to include \\nonly the tools referred to in Annex V, points 5 and 6 ”. \\n \\n2 Directive (EU) 2024/927 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13  March 2024 amending Directives  2011/61/EU \\nand 2009/65/EC as regards delegation arrangements, liquidity risk management, supervisory reporting, the provision of \\ndepositary and custody services and loan origination by alternative investment funds (europa.eu)   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\n9. By way of derogation, a UCITS that is authorised as a Money Market Fund (MMF) and \\nan AIFM that manages an AIF authorised as an MMF3 may decide to select only one \\nLMT from the above  lists. \\n10. In addition, UCITS/AIFMs should always have the possibility of temporarily suspending \\nsubscriptions, repurchases and redemptions or of activating side pockets, in \\nexceptional circumstances and where justified having regard to the interests of the \\nUCITS/AIF’s investors.   \\n11. Against this background, suspensions of subscriptions , repurchases  and redemptions \\nand side pockets can always be activated in exceptional circumstances and in the best \\ninterest of the investors, without the need for the UCITS/AIFM to “pre -select” them.    \\n12. On the contrary, the “other” LMTs4 , i.e.: redemption gates, extension of notice periods, \\nredemption fee, swing pricing, dual pricing, Anti -Dilution Levy (ADL), redemption in \\nkind) can be activated by the UCITS/AIFM s only if selected and included in the fund’s \\nrules and instruments of incorporation among the selected LMTs.  \\n13. With regards to the calibration  of LMTs , the mandate  does not set any limitations. \\nTherefore, the guidelines should cover the calibration of all LMTs  listed , respectively,  \\nin Annex IIA  of the UCITSD and Annex V  of the AIFMD , including suspensions of \\nsubscriptions, repurchases and redemptions and side pockets.  \\n14. As regards to the activation of LMTs, while the UCITSD and AIFMD refer to  the \\nactivation of side pockets only, ESMA deems important setting minimum expectations , \\nas well as examples,  in order to identify instances that may lead to the activation of  all \\nLMTs . \\n15. For ease of reference, in this CP references to ‘funds’ should be understood as \\nreferences to both UCITS and open -ended AIFs. Similarly, references to ‘managers’ \\nshould be understood as references to both Alternative Investment Fund Managers \\n(AIFMs) of open -ended AIFs and Management Companies. In case there are \\nprovisions that apply only to one type of funds or fund managers, the n the text \\nspecifically refers to UCITS, AIFs, AIFMs or Management Companies.5 \\n \\n3 In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1131 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on money \\nmarket funds (OJ L 169, 30.6.2017, p. 8).  \\n4 Those referred to in Annex IIA, point 2 to 8, of the UCITSD and in Annex V, points 2 to 8 of the AIFMD . \\n5 For a list of legislative references, abbreviations and definitions used in this CP, please see Section 2 of the draft Guidel ines.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n2.1 Scope of the Guidelines  \\n16. Against this background , the proposed scope of the draft ESMA Guidelines on LMTs \\nof UCITS and open -ended AIFs is the following:  \\n  Selection  Calibration  Activation  and, \\nwhere appropriate, \\ndeactivation   \\nA. Suspension  of \\nsubscriptions, repurchases \\nand redemptions          Minimum \\nexpectations/examples  \\nB. LMTs points 2 to 8 of the \\nAnnexes6 (i.e.: redemption \\ngate, extension of notice \\nperiods, redemption fee, \\nswing pricing, dual pricing, \\nanti-dilution levy, \\nredemption in kind)   \\n            \\n        \\nMinimum \\nexpectations/examples  \\nC. Side pockets                 \\n \\n17. For the purpose of  the Guidelines, A and C above are also referred to as “available \\nLMT(s)”, and B as “selected LMT(s)”.7 \\n2.2 Type of LMTs  \\n18. As highlighted by the IOSCO Final Report on Anti -Dilution Liquidity Management \\nTools8, LMTs can be broadly divided in Anti -Dilution Tools (ADTs , or price -based tools, \\nas they adjust the final price received or paid by investors ) and quantitative -based \\nLMTs. While the first “ aim to pass on the estimated costs of liquidity associated with \\nfund subscriptions/redemptions to the subscribing / redeeming investors by adjusting \\n \\n6 Annex IIA, point 2 to 8, of the UCITSD and in Annex V, points 2 to 8 of the AIFMD.  \\n7 See also the Definition section of the guidelines  further below . \\n8 FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for \\nLiquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\nthe NAV of the OEF or the price at which they transact ”, the latter  “operate by reducing \\nthe liquidity obligations of OEFs through delaying / deferring payments to investors ”.9 \\n19. Against this background, in order to ensure alignment with the IOSCO principles , the \\nproposed guidance adopts the following distinction : \\nType of LMT  LMTs  \\nAnti-Dilution Tools \\n(ADT)  Redemption fees, swing pricing, dual pricing, Anti-\\nDilution Levy (ADL)  \\nQuantitative LMTs  Suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions, redemption gates, extension of notice \\nperiod.  \\nOther LMTs  Redemptions in kind, s ide pockets  \\n2.3 General principles  \\n20. As stated in the revised UCITS Directive and AIFMD, t he primary responsibility for \\nliquidity risk management  remain s with the manager , who shall select and include in \\nthe fund’s  rules or instruments of incorporatio n at least two  appropriate LMTs from the \\nfollowing  list: redemption gates, extension of notice periods, redemption fee, swing \\npricing, dual pricing, Anti -Dilution Levy (ADL), redemption in kind.10  \\n21. By way of derogation, a UCITS that is authorised as a MMF and an AIFM that manages \\nan AIF authorised as a MMF may decide to select only one  of the LMTs referred to in \\nthe above paragraph . \\n22. Therefore, t he primary responsibility for liquidity risk management, as well as for the \\nselection, calibration , activation  and deactivation  of LMTs is of the manager. In the \\nselection of appropriate LMTs , managers should give due consideration that the \\n \\n9 Ibidem , p. 4.  \\n10  Those are the LMTs  referred to in Annex IIA, point 2 to 8, of the revised UCITSD and in Annex V, points 2 to 8 of the revised \\nAIFMD. Furthermore, in  light of Article 18a paragraph 2 of the revised UCITD and Article 16 paragraph 2b of the revised AIFMD, \\nit shall not be possible to select only swing pricing and dual pricing.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\nselected tools will allow to effectively manage the fund’s liquidity  risk in both normal \\nand stressed market conditions  and be as comprehensive as possible . \\n23. Without prejudice to the use of tools to mitigate against the dilution of investor interests, \\nmanagers should not solely rely on LMTs to manage a fund’s liquidity  risk.  LMTs \\nshould be considered as an essential element of the fund’s overall liquidity \\nmanagement framework, which should incorporate relevant provisions related to the \\nfund’s structure, investment strategy and operational processes and procedures to \\nmanage liquidity.  \\n24. LMTs should not be seen as a backstop for the purpose of addressing liquidity issues \\nstemming from inadequate fund structuring, poor investment decisions, inappropriate \\nrisk management or other management failings.   \\n25. The activati on and deactivat ion of LMTs  should  not exempt  managers from their \\nobligations on best execution, eligibility of assets , fair valuation of assets , liquidity risk \\nmanagement  and fair treatment of investors , as well as  the obligation to ensure \\nconsistency between  the investment strategy, the liquidity profile and the redemption \\npolicy  of the fund .11  \\n26. In light of the legislative mandate,  manager s shall select LMTs after assessing the \\nsuitability of those tools in relation to the pursued investment strategy, the liquidity \\nprofile , as well as the distribution policy ( e.g.: the levy to be applied by the platform) \\nand the redemption policy of the fund  as further detailed under paragraph 17 of Section \\n6.5.1 of the draft guidelines.  \\nQ1: Do you agree with the list of elements included under paragraph 17 of Section \\n6.5.1 of the draft guidelines that the manager should consider in the selection of \\nLMTs? Are there any other elements that should be considered ?  \\nQ2: Should the distribution policy of the fund be considered in the selection of the \\nLMTs?  What are the current practices in relation to the application of anti -dilution \\nlevies by third party distributors (e.g.: whether the third party corrects the price by \\nadding the anti -dilution levy to the fund NAV) ? \\n27. While the amended legislations  require the selection of at least two appropriate LMTs \\nfrom the list provided in Annex V (for AIFMD) and Annex IIA (for UCITS Directive), \\n \\n11 See Article 40(4) of Commission Directive 2010/43/EU and Article 16(2) of the AIFMD .  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\nmanagers have the discretion to select more LMTs , as well as additional liquidity \\nmeasures , according to the criteria set out in the previous paragraph , in order to ensure \\nthe fund ’s overall resilience and ability to manage its liquidity during both normal and \\nstressed market conditions.  \\n28. Bearing in mind that the primary responsibility for the selection of LMTs remains within \\nthe manager, ESMA deems important providing some indications on what manager \\nshould consider in the selection of LMTs.    \\n29. According to  the revised FSB Recommendation 4, “ Authorities should ensure that a \\nbroad set of liquidity management tools and measures is available for use by managers \\nof open -ended funds in normal and stressed market conditions as part of robust \\nliquidity management practices. Authorities should also re duce operational and other \\nbarriers that prevent the use of such tools and measures ”12. In this context, when \\nconsidering the set of LMTs available to managers, the FSB recommends a balance \\nbetween ADTs and quantity based  LMTs. If operationalised effectively, ADTs can in \\nfact reduce redemptions arising from potential first -mover advantage .  \\n30. Against this background, in the selection of the two minimum mandatory LMTs, \\nmanagers should consider, where appropriate, the merit of selecting at least one \\nquantitative -based LMT (i.e.: redemption gates, extension of notice period) and at least \\none ADT (i.e.: redemption fees, swi ng pricing, dual pricing, ADL), taking into \\nconsideration the investment strategy, redemption policy and liquidity profile of the \\nfund and the market conditions under which the LMT could be activated . In this context, \\nmanagers may  consider whether to select one LMT to use under  normal market \\nconditions and one LMT to be used under stressed market conditions (for instance, \\none ADT to use for normal market conditions and one quantitative LMT to be used \\nunder stressed market conditions).   \\nQ3: Do you agree that among the two minimum LMTs managers should consider the \\nmerit of selecti ng of at least one quantitative LMT and at least one ADT , in light of \\nthe investment strategy, redemption policy and liquidity profile of the fund ? \\n \\n12 See Revised Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open -Ended Funds \\n(fsb.org) , p. 17.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n11 \\n31. When considering the activation of an LMT, an assessment of whether to activate \\nLMTs individually or in combination with additional LMTs or other liquidity measures \\nshould be undertaken in each instance.  \\n32. Managers should be able to demonstrate , under the request of  the NCA , that the  \\nactivation and  calibration(s) of the selected LMTs is  (are) in the best interest of all \\ninvestors and are appropriate and effective for the prevailing market conditions, be that  \\nnormal or stressed.  \\n33. The activation of a specific LMT  or its calibration  should not in any way alter  or change \\nthe fund’s investment objectives, policy, profile or characteristics as stated in the fund’s \\nrules , offering documents or instruments of incorporation .  \\n34. When activating and calibrating LMTs, m anagers should ensure that there is no \\npossibility of modifying orders after the centrali sation date where the order will be \\nprocessed, including through cancellation requests.13 Managers should ensure that the \\nlevel of subscription and redemption orders received is treated with the strictest \\nconfidentiality , in order to avoid that some investors can benefit from information on \\nthe probability that LMTs may be activated  (e.g.: activation thresholds may be reached \\nin case of redemption gates) . \\n35. Managers should calibrate and activate LMTs based on the unique attributes of the \\nfund (e.g.: the liquidity profile, the type of underlying assets, the investor base) and the \\nprevailing market conditions.  \\n36. Under both the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, depositaries are required to \\nimplement procedures to verify that the fund is acting in compliance with obligations \\nunder those Directives.14Therefore, a  depositary should set up appropriate verification \\nprocedures to check that managers have in place documented procedures for LMTs.  \\nQ4: Do you see merit in developing  further specific guidance on the depositaries’ \\nduties , including on verification procedures,  with regards to LMTs ?  \\n \\n13 This is without prejudice to the separate provisions proposed under Article 2 of the CP on RTS on the characteristics of LMTs  \\nunder the AIFMD and UCITS Directive ( ESMA34 -1985 6933 17-1095) , whereby  investors may ask for the cancellation of the non -\\nexecuted part of their redemption orders in case of activation of redemption gates .   \\n14 In the case of UCITS, under Article 3(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/438. In the case of AIFMD, under \\nArticle 95 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12 \\n2.4 Governance principles  \\n37. Both IOSCO and the FSB highlight the importance of establishing a n adequate and \\nappropriate governance for their liquidity risk management processes, including on the \\nuse of LMTs15.  \\n38. The selected LMTs should therefore  be properly integrated and embedded in the \\nfund’s liquidity risk management framework.   \\n39. In light of the IOSCO guidance, the internal governance arrangements should at least \\ninclude  the following elements : a) objective criteria (e.g.: activation thresholds)  for the \\napplication of LMTs ; b) methodology, including calibration; c) parties involved (e.g.: \\nsenior management, risk management , etc.); d) source of information and data used; \\ne) controls; f) documentation of decisions made; g) escalation processes; h) oversight \\nby the governing body.  \\n40. The revised AIFMD and UCITSD also provide that the UCITS  and AIFM “ shall \\nimplement detailed policies and procedures for the activation and deactivation of any \\nselected liquidity management tool and the operational and administrative \\narrangements for the use of such tool ”.16 \\n41. Against this background,  it is important that t he selected LMTs, the methodology for \\ntheir calibration, as well as the conditions for their selection, activation /deactivation , \\nare detailed in a documented LMT policy (“the LMT policy ”).  \\n42. The LMT policy , which  should form part of the broader fund liquidity risk management \\nprocess policy document , should  also document the conditions for the  \\nactivation /deactivation  and calibration of the available LMTs .17  \\n \\n15 “The relevant authorities have an important role to play in setting expectations on how these decisions could be made with \\nrespect to fund governance, for example through involvement by the fund board of directors (where relevant) and communication  \\nto unith olders and the relevant authorities (see also Recommendation 8). The more prepared asset managers and fund investors \\nare with respect to the use of quantity  based LMTs and other liquidity management measures in stressed market conditions, the \\nmore effective such tools and measures are likely to be when used ”. See Revised Policy Recommendations to Address Structural \\nVulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open -Ended Funds (fsb.org) , p. 20. See IOSCO’s Recommendation 8 whereby “ The \\nresponsible entity’s  liquidity risk management process must  be supported by strong and effective governance ”, FR15/23 Anti -\\ndilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for Liquidity Risk \\nManagement for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org) , p. 18 . See also, Section II of the document. Both  the FSB and \\nIOSCO  highlight the link between internal governance and appropriate disclosure to investors on the objectives, design and use \\nof LMTs.  \\n16 See Art. 18 paragraph 2 of the revised UCITSD and Art. 16 paragraph 2b of the revised AIFMD.  \\n17 The “available LMTs” are: suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions and side pockets . See Section II.1 and  \\nthe Definition section of the guidelines.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n43. The LMT policy should include provisions on a series of aspects and, at least , on the \\nones included under paragraph 28 of Section 6.5.2 of the draft guidelines. Those \\ninclude clear and objective criteria for the selection, activation/deactivation of the \\nselected and available LMTs, the governance framework , the methodology, disclosure \\nto investors.  \\n44. In case  the manager has selected ADT (s) as LMTs, the LMT policy should document \\nthe nature of the costs taken into account, the rules regarding the distribution of these \\ncosts between entering, exiting or remaining holders, as well as the estimation \\nmethodology , which should be based  on documented and justifiable criteria  and \\nreviewed at least every six months. Managers should document all methodologies and \\ncalculations in such a way as to allow traceability and ensure their logging.   \\nQ5: Do you agree with the list of elements  included under paragraph 28 of Section \\n6.5.2 of the draft guidelines  to be included in the LMT  policy? A re the re any  other \\nelements that, in your view, should be included in the LMT policy?  \\nQ6: In your view, what are the elements of the LMT policy that should be disclosed \\nto investors and what are the ones that should not be disclosed? Please provide \\nreasons for your answer .  \\n2.5 Quantitative -based LMTs  \\n2.5.1  Suspension of subscriptions , repurchases and redemptions  \\nActivation   \\n45. The Directives indicate that suspensions of subscriptions , repurchases and \\nredemptions can always be activated in exceptional circumstances and in the best \\ninterest of the investors, without the need for the UCITS/AIFM to select  this LMT . \\n46. Managers should consider the activation of suspension of subscriptions, repurchases \\nand redemptions  only in exceptional circumstances . As indicated in the Background \\nsection, the Guidelines aim at providing indications of which are the “ exceptional \\ncircumstances ” that could require the activation of this LMTs. Exceptional \\ncircumstances can be defined as unforeseen events and/or operational/regulatory \\nenvironments that impact materially on the fund’s ability to carry out normal business \\nfunctions and activit ies and which would temporarily prevent the manager to meet the  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\nfunding obligations arising from the liabilities side of the balance sheet . Paragraph 30 \\nof Section 6.5.3.1 of the draft guidelines include a  non-exhaustive list  of examples of \\nexceptional circumstances.   \\nQ7: Do you agree with the above definition of “exceptional circumstances”? Can you \\nprovide examples of additional exceptional  circumstances, not included under \\nparagraph 30 of Section 6.5.3.1 of the draft guidelines , that would require the \\nmanager to consider the activation of suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions, having regard to the interests of the fund’s investor s?  \\n47. The suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions may be applied \\ntogether with a suspension of the NAV calculation , particularly  in case of uncertain \\nvaluation  and where it is not possible to compute the NAV of the fund(s) . In other cases , \\nand whenever possible, the manager should continue to value the assets in the fund \\nand publish a NAV  to ensure a proper information to investors.  \\n48. While suspensions of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  can, in some \\ncases, anticipate the manager’s decision to liquidate the fund, as they allow time to the \\nmanager to assess whether the fund is no longer viable, managers should ensure that \\nsuspensions of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  are activated only on a \\ntemporary basis (i.e.: with the view not to permanently suspend the fund, but to re -\\nopen it , or liquidate it  or activate side pockets , if necessary,  at a certain point in time) . \\nTo this end, prior to or immediately after the activation of the suspension of \\nsubscriptions, repurchases and redemptions , managers should formalise  a detailed \\nplan (the “LMT plan”) that should be in line with the LMT policy  and should include , \\nwhere relevant , the elements  included under paragraph 32 of Section 6.5.3.1 of the \\ndraft guidelines. Those element s include a description of the exceptional \\ncircumstances, the possibility to combine the LMT with other  LMTs  and the disclosure \\nto investors .  \\nQ8: Do you agree with the elements of the LMT plan included under paragraph 32 of \\nSection 6.5.3.1 of the draft guidelines to be included in the LMT plan ? Is there any \\nother element that should be considered?  \\nCalibration   \\n49. Relevant calibrations for the suspension of subscription s, repurchases and \\nredemptions should  include:   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\na) determining the  activation threshold for a suspension . This should also take into \\naccount , legal and regulatory requirements . Any mechanistic  approach should be \\navoided to ensure that the LMT allow s a timely intervention in order to address the \\nexceptional circumstances that prompted its activation ; \\nb) the criteria for assessing and monitoring the conditions that prompted the \\nactivation  of the suspension of subscription s, repurchases and redemptions;  \\nc) determining when the conditions referred to under para graph b) no longer exist; \\nand \\nd) the criteria for reviewing and potentially revising the decision to suspend and the \\nchange in circumstances that would warrant this.  \\nQ9: Do you agree with the above list of elements to calibrate the suspensions of \\nsubscriptions, repurchases and redemptions ? Is there any other element that should \\nbe considered?  \\n2.5.2  Redemption gates  \\n50. According to the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive, redemption gates mean a \\ntemporary and partial restriction of the right of unitholders  or shareholders to redeem \\ntheir units or shares, so that investors can only redeem a certain portion of their units \\nor shares.  Contrary to suspensions of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions , a \\nfund that applies redemption gates could still be open for subscriptions and the \\nrestrictions only apply to the redemptions.  \\nSelection  \\n51. Managers should consider the selection of redemption gates for all funds, as all assets \\ncould potentially become less liquid during stressed market conditions and the use of \\nthis LMT could be useful to avoid the activation of suspension of subscriptions, \\nrepurchases and redemptions . \\n52. The selection of redemption gates:  \\na) should be considered especially by :  \\ni) manager s of funds with a strongly concentrated investor base, where a \\nredemption of a significant size could cause liquidity issues to the fund and affect  \\ninvestors (particularly the remaining ones);   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\nii) managers of funds whose assets might become less liquid  during stressed \\nmarket conditions  and/or that might take longer time to sell ;  \\niii) AIFMs managing AIFs whose assets might be structurally illiquid/hard to \\nliquidate (e.g.: Real Estate (RE) funds and/or Private Equity (PE) funds ). \\nb) could be less suited in case of valuation issues, in which case the manager may \\nconsider the use of other LMTs (e.g.: suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions , together with the suspension of the NAV).  \\nQ10: Do you agree with the proposed criteria for the selection of redemption gates?  \\nIs there any other  criteria that should be consider ed?  \\nActivation  \\n53. The activation of redemption gates should be considered in cases of significant  calls \\non a fund’s liquidity  and can be automatic or at the discretion of the manager when the \\nactivation threshold is exceeded . \\n54. For funds marketed to retail investors,  redemption gates should not be activated  to \\nmanage  the fund’s liquidity  on a day -to-day basis , but should be activated in specific \\ncircumstances and carefully calibrated , for instance, to address severe liquidity \\nstresses or stressed market conditions  where executing the sale of underlying assets \\ncould worsen  liquidity issues  of the fund .  \\n55. The activation threshold  should be disclosed in the fund’s rules, offering documents or \\ninstruments of incorporation .   \\nQ11: What methodology should be used and which elements  should be taken into \\naccount when setting the activation threshold  of redemption gates ?            \\nCalibration  \\n56. Managers should calibrate the activation threshold in order to ensure that it operates  \\neffectively and in the best interest of investors at all times . In calibrating  such threshold, \\nmanager s should give due consideration to  the NAV calculation frequency, the \\ninvestment objective of the fund and the liquidity of the underlying assets and should \\nensure that investors are able to redeem their units or shares under normal market \\nconditions.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\n57. The use of redemption gates should not be restricted in terms of the maximum period \\nover which they can be used (maximum duration of redemption gates) , or the \\nmaximum number of times that redemption gates can be activated (maximum use of \\nredemption gates) , as long as it remains temporary in nature .  These matters should \\nbe determined by the manager on a case -by-case basis . \\nQ12: Do you agree  that the use of redemption gates should not be restricted in terms \\nof the maximum period over which they can be used ? Do you think that any \\ndifferentiation should be made for funds marketed to retail investors? Please provide \\nconcrete cases and examples in your response.  \\nQ13: What is the methodology that managers should use to calibrate the activation \\nthreshold of redemption gate s to ensure that the calibration is effective so that the \\ngate can be activated when it is needed? Do you think that activation thresholds \\nshould be calibrated based on historical redemption requests and the results of \\nLSTs?  \\nQ14: In order to ensure more  harmonisation o n the use of redemption gates, a fixed \\nminimum activation threshold, above which managers could have the option to \\nactivate the redemption gate, could be recommended. Do you think that a fixed \\nminimum threshold would be appropriate,  or do you think that this choice should be \\nleft to the manager?  \\nQ15: If you think that a fixed minimum threshold should be recommended, do  you \\nagree  that for daily dealing funds (except ETFs and MMFs) it should be set  as \\nfollows : \\na) at 5% for daily net redemptions ; and \\nb) at 10% for cumulat ive net redemptions received during a week?  \\n \\n2.5.3  Extension of notice periods  \\n58. By definition, t he extension of notice periods is based on the already existing notice \\nperiod of the fund, which is set at its inception/design phase  based on the liquidity of \\nthe underlying assets .  \\nSelection   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\n59. As it creates a time buffer to sell the underlying assets, t he selection of extension of \\nnotice periods should be available to all funds but is recommended for funds whose \\nliquidity can deteriorate quickly in times of stress.  \\nQ16: Do you agree with the proposed criteria for the selection of the extension of \\nnotice period? Are there any other criteria that  should be consider ed?  \\n60. In light of  the additional time that may be  needed in order to liquidate the portfolio , the \\nselection of the extension of notice periods is recommended for AIFs invested in less \\nliquid assets and, particularly, for RE and PE funds which should already have in place \\nan appropriate  notice period that is in line with the level of liquidity of their assets under \\nnormal market conditions.  \\n61. While Article 76 of the UCITSD sets out a minimum dealing frequency of twice of a \\nmonth (and, if authorised by the NCA, once a month) 18, the AIFMD does not require a \\nminimum redemption frequency. However, Article 16(2) of the AIFMD provides that \\n“AIFMs shall ensure that, for each AIF that they manage, the investment strategy, the \\nliquidity profile and the redemption policy are consistent ”. Furthermore, Article 72(1) of \\nthe AIFMD L2 provides that “ an AIFM shall ensure that for each AIF it manages the \\nnet asset value per unit or share is calculated on the occasion of each issue or \\nsubscription or redemption or cancellation of units or shares, but at least once a year ”. \\nAs recently highlighted by the FSB, better alignment between asset liquidity and \\nredemption terms “ may be effective in reducing the systemic vulnerabilities of real \\nestate funds and other funds that invest in inherently illiquid assets” .19 The importance \\nof ensuring ongoing supervision of the alignment between the funds’ investment \\nstrategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy  was also stressed by ESMA, in \\nnumerous occasions20. \\nQ17: According to the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive, the extension of notice \\nperiods means extending the period of notice that unit -holders or shareholders must \\n \\n18 According to Article 76 of the UCITSD “A UCITS shall make public in an appropriate manner the issue, sale, repurchase or \\nredemption price of its units each time it issues, sells, repurchases or redeems them, and at least twice a month. The competent \\nauthorities may, however, permit a UCITS to reduce the frequency to once a month on condition that such derogation does not \\nprejudice the interests of the unit -holders ”. \\n19 See Response to FSB consultation on Addressing Structural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open -Ended Funds – \\nRevisions to the FSB’s 2017 Policy Recommendations , p. 39.  \\n20 See the 2020 ESMA Report in response to the May 2020 ESRB Recommendation and the ESMA Final Report on the 2022 \\nCSA on valuation, available, respectively at esma34 -39-1119 -\\nreport_on_the_esrb_recommendation_on_liquidity_risks_in_funds.pdf (europa.eu)  and ESMA34 -45-\\n1802_2022_CSA_on_Asset_Valuation_ -_Final_Report.pdf (europa.eu) .   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n19 \\ngive to fund managers, beyond a minimum period which is appropriate to the fund . \\nIn your view , for RE and PE funds: i)  what would be an appropriate minimum notice \\nperiod ; and ii) would the extension of notice period be an appropriate LMT to select ? \\nQ18: Do you think the length of the extension of notice periods should be \\nproportiona te to the length of the notice period of the fund ? Do you think a standard/ \\nmaximum extended notice period should be set for UCITS?  \\nActivation  \\n62. The activation of extension of notice periods should be considered both under normal \\nand stressed market conditions  and it may be useful  in specific circumstances, for \\ninstance, in case of redemption pressures and/or temporary valuation uncertainty.  \\nQ19: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of the extension of notice \\nperiod? Are there any other criteria that  should be consider ed?  \\nCalibration  \\n63. In the calibration of the extension of notice periods, manager s should consider, where \\nappropriate, the time necessary for the orderly liquid ation of  the underlying instruments  \\nin the best interest of the investor s. \\n64. In order t o avoid an increase of  redemptions  requests , managers should carefully \\nconsider at what time to announce  and activate  the extension of notice periods . \\nQ20: Do you have any comments on the guidance on the calibration of the extension \\nof notice periods?  \\n2.5.4  Redemption s in kind   \\n65. The revised Directives provide that “redemptions in kind shall only be activated to meet \\nredemptions requested by professional investors and if the redemption in kind \\ncorresponds to a pro rata share of the assets held by the AIF ”. By way of derogation, \\n“the redemption in kind need not correspond to a pro rata share of the assets held by \\nthe AIF  [UCITS]  if that AIF [UCITS] is solely marketed to professional investors, or if \\nthe aim of that AIF’s  [UCITS’]  investment policy is to replicate the composition of a \\ncertain stock or debt securities index and that AIF [UCITS] is an exchange -traded \\nfund”. \\nSelection   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n66. In selecting redemptions in kind, m anagers should consider the applicable restrictions \\nthat apply to the use of redemptions -in-kind and its permitted application  to \\nprofessional investors  only, i.e. managers of funds which are marketed to both retail \\nand professional investors should carefully assess the merit of selecting redemptions \\nin kind as one of the two minimum LMTs in light of their  potential limited usability and \\ntheir expected impact on the fund(s) they manage . \\nQ21: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of redemptions in kind? \\nAre there any other criteria that should be considered ?  \\nActivation  \\n67. Redemption in kind should be activated  on the NAV calculation dates , in light of the \\nminimum valuation frequency set out in the [UCITSD] / [AIFMD L2]  at the discretion of \\nthe manager , as foreseen in the fund’s prospectus/articles of incorporation . \\n68. In case of the activation of redemptions in kind, an independent third party (e.g.: the \\nfund auditor, depositary) should perform an additional valuation of the asset(s)  to be \\nredeemed in kind .  \\nQ22: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of redemptions in kind? \\nAre there any other criteria that should be considered ?  \\nQ23: Do you think that redemptions in kind should only be activated on the NAV \\ncalcula tion dates ? \\nQ24: What are the  criteria  to be followed by the managers  for the selection of the \\nassets to be redeemed in kind in order to  ensure fair treatment of investors?  \\nQ25: How should redemptions in kind be calibrated ? \\n2.6 Anti-Dilution Tools (ADT)  \\n69. Anti-dilution tools (ADT) are methodologies to address the dilution of investor interests \\nassociated with the creation and/or redemption of shares/units by investors.  According \\nto the IOSCO guidance on ADTs, anti -dilution LMTs “ aim to pass on the estimated \\ncosts of liquidity associated with fund subscriptions / redemptions to the subscribing /  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n21 \\nredeeming investors by adjusting the NAV of the OEF or the price at which they \\ntransact ”21.  \\n70. Against this background, m anagers should consider the selection of ADTs for all types \\nof funds to mitigate material investor dilution and potential first mover advantage. This \\nis the case, in particular, for those funds which invest in assets that are less liquid or \\nare usually liquid but can become less liquid during stressed market conditions (and \\nare therefore exposed to substantial dilution risks), and for whom the liquidation cost \\nof the u nderlying assets may increase significantly.  \\n71. Managers  should have appropriate internal systems, procedures and controls in place \\nat all times in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the design, \\ncalibration and use of ADTs as part of their liquidity risk management framework. \\nManagers should identify the risks specific to the selected ADTs and implement an \\nappropriate system of controls to mitigate such risks , even if such tools would not \\nalways be activated .   \\n72. When selecting and activating ADTs, managers should note that ADTs share similar \\nfeatures and may deliver similar outcomes in similar conditions.  It is to be noted that \\nunder the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive, it shall not be possible for the selection \\nof the two minimum LMTs to include only swing pricing and dual -pricing.  While t he \\nsimultaneous selection and activation  of other ADTs (e.g.: swing pricing and anti -\\ndilution levies)  is not excluded under the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive,  it could \\npotentially lead to duplicating impacts and may have the potential to undermine \\nbroader liquidity risk management objectives .  \\nQ26: Do you agree  that managers should consider the merit of avoid ing the \\nsimultaneous activation  of certain ADTs (e.g.: swing pricing and anti -dilution \\nlevies)? Please provide examples when illustrating your answer . \\n \\n21 See FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for \\nLiquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org) , p. 4. In this context, the IOSCO guidance points out \\nthat “ a key element of the policy discussions around OEF liquidity risk management is the balance among various LMTs and \\nliquidity risk management measures. From that perspective, quantity -based LMTs, such as suspensions of redemptions and \\nredemption gates, have  typically been activated as ex -post tools in response to increased redemptions or when responsible \\nentities face major valuation issues. Exclusive reliance on such ex -post tools may result in unintended consequences. For \\nexample, investor expectations tha t an OEF will use quantity -based LMTs may motivate investors to front -run potential restrictions \\non redemptions, which may add to redemption pressures. In this context, anti -dilution LMTs, if operationalised effectively, are a \\nuseful and recommended tool t o address the investor dilution issue and the potential financial stability issue at their source while \\nbeing less prone to the unintended consequences associated with quantity -based LMTs. This would also put fund unitholders in \\na similar economic position  to investors that opt to invest directly in portfolio securities ”. Ibidem .   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n73. While ADTs are generally applicable to a wide range of funds, managers should \\ndetermine the applicability of individual ADTs for a fund in both normal and stressed \\nmarket conditions.   \\n74. ADTs may have different rules around when they are activated and the thresholds for \\nactivation. Managers should carefully assess  the different levels  for the activation of \\nADTs at fund level and should set appropriate  and prudent activation threshold so as \\nto avoid  any material dilution impact on investors or o n the fund in both normal and \\nstressed market conditions depending on the investment strategy , assets under \\nmanagement , size and portfolio characteristics (including the investment strategy and \\nasset liquidity), estimated cost of liquidity, investor profile , liquidity profile of each fund  \\nand historical  fund flows.  \\n75. The activation of ADTs may be more challenging in certain circumstances, where for \\nexample there is limited market liquidity and/or in cases of valuation uncertainty. In \\nthose case s managers should consider the use of other LMTs in addition to ADTs (e.g.: \\nquantity based LMTs).   \\n76. The activation of ADTs should not affect the manager’s duty to value the fund(s) at fair \\nvalue at all times . \\n77. Managers may activate ADTs, both under normal and stressed market conditions, to \\nimpose on subscribing and/or redeeming investors the estimated costs of liquidity. As \\nfurther indicated under paragraph 56 of Section 6.5.4 of the draft guidelines, the \\nestimated cost of liquidity should  include both explicit and implicit transaction costs, be \\nbased, as a starting point, on costs associated with transacting a pro -rata slice of all \\nassets in the portfolio  and be estimated in a documented manner.22 \\nQ27: Do you agree with the list of elements provided under  paragraph 56 of Section \\n6.5.4 of the draft guidelines ? Is there any other element that should be included in \\nthe estimated  cost of liquidity?  \\n78. As the calibration of ADTs aims at reflecting the estimated costs of liquidity , this should \\nbe adjustable when needed, even if a normal range of adjustment factors / fees is \\ndisclosed or set. To this effect,  in exceptional circumstance s, the disclosed range of \\n \\n22 In line  with the IOSCO guidance on ADTs available at the following link:  \\nhttps://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD756.pdf    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n23 \\nadjustments should not be considered as a cap or restriction that would prevent ADTs  \\nfrom achieving their objectives to mitigate material dilution and potential first -mover \\nadvantages arising from investor transactions . Managers should include in the fund’s \\nrules, offering documents or instruments of incorporation, relevant disclosures on \\nADTs. These disclosures should explicitly state the ranges of liquidity cost adjustment, \\nthat these ranges could be exceeded on an exce ptional basis if justified by the ma rket \\nconditions, the governance structures around any changes and the factors driving \\nthese . \\n79. In any case, managers should be able to demonstrate , at the request of the  NCA , that \\nthe calibration of ADTs is fair and reasonable for both normal and stressed market \\nconditions, taking into account the best interests of investors. This should be supported \\nby a strong liquidity risk management framework, which should include periodi c back -\\ntesting and strong governance.  \\n80. Manager s should identify the risks specific to ADT and set up an appropriate control \\nsystem.   \\n81. Managers should not calibrate ADTs in a way that could help to artificially improve the \\nperformance of the fund.   \\nQ28: Do you have any other comments on the proposed  general  guidance on ADTs ? \\n2.6.1  Redemption fee  \\nSelection  \\n82. Managers may consider the selection of redemption fees for all types of funds, but \\nredemption fees may be most applicable to  funds : \\na) that invest in assets which  have fixed/transparent/foreseeable transaction costs , \\nsuch as RE agency fees or notary fees, and / or that have low -variation transaction \\ncosts (e.g.: fixed taxes and levies on RE transactions);  \\nb) that are AIFs invested in less liquid assets where other ADTs, such as swing \\npricing, might be challenging or impossible to implement (e.g.: RE assets) due to \\ninfrequent and limited pricing sources;  \\nc) that invest in assets that have low -variation transaction costs ; and   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\nd) whose underlying assets do not have very frequent and reliable pricing sources \\navailable from various different trading venues ( as opposed to other  assets , e.g. \\nequities) . \\nQ29: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of redemption fees?  Is \\nthere any other criteria that  should  be consider ed? \\n Activatio n \\n83. In the activation of redemption fees, managers may set activation thresholds that could \\nbe expressed as the size of redemption orders above which redemption fees will be \\ncharged to redeeming investors . \\nQ30: Do you have any views  on how to set the activation thresholds for redemption \\nfees? \\nCalibration  \\n84. In the calibration of redemption fees , managers should apply a methodology that: \\na) ensures the coverage of the cost of liquidity , including estimated explicit and \\nimplicit costs where applicable (e.g.: mapping what the cost  of liquidity  would be \\nwithin predetermined redemption thresholds and charge those costs to the \\nredemption fee, where appropriate);   \\nb) while static , allows  for adjust ment, whe n required  to reflect the higher cost of \\nliquidity  or stressed market conditions ; \\nc) is disclosed in the fund documentation and prospectus to ensure appropriate \\ninformation of investors .  \\n85. Managers should consider whether to calibrate the redemption fee as a single fee or \\nwhether it is  adjusted based on a tiered approach corresponding to the amount of net \\nfund flows  (i.e. the larger the redemption order the higher the redemption fee ). \\nQ31: Do you have any comments the calibration of redemption fees?  \\n2.6.2  Swing pricing  \\nSelection   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\n86. Managers should consider t he selection of swing pricing for funds whose underlying \\nassets are actively traded and information on trading costs (bid/ask) is available and \\nfrequently updated, particularly where  the funds invest mainly in assets with market \\ncontingent liquidity costs. Swing pricing may be less appropriate in cases of valuation \\nuncertainty.  \\nQ32: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of swing pricing? Is there \\nany other criteria that  should  be consider ed? \\n Activation  \\n87. The decision to activate a specific swing pricing model (i.e.: full, partial with a single or \\ntiered swing factor), as well as the calibration of the swing factor should be dynamic \\nand based on market conditions , based on a methodology that is established by the \\nmanager  and documented in the LMT policy . It should be noted that a tiered swing \\npricing system may be de facto  always activated  without any material effect on the \\nNAV for low levels of flows.  \\n88. The manager should disclose to investors relevant details governing the activation of \\nswing pricing both for normal and stressed market conditions . The activation threshold \\nfor swing pricing should not be disclosed in order to avoid first mover advantage.  \\nQ33: Under w hich circumstances should  the manager consider the activation of \\nswing pricing?  \\nCalibration  \\n89. When calibrating swing pricing, managers should ensure that the full cost of liquidity , \\nin light of the market conditions , is incorporated  in the swing factor, including any \\nsignificant market impact of the trades. By design, swing pricing should ensure that the \\nNAV is always adjusted to market conditions.  The estimation of the liquidity costs of \\nthe assets in the portfolio should be carried out in a documented manner and on the \\nbasis of justifiable data.  \\n90. The manager should disclose to investors a maximum swing pricing factor for normal \\nmarket conditions but should also be able to  recalibrate it for stressed market \\nconditions . The possibility to recalibrat e the swing factor  beyond the maximum factor \\nin exceptional market conditions  should be  established within a clearly described \\nframework  and clearly  disclos ed to investors  in the prospectus .   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\nQ34: Do you agree with the above principles that a manager should follow in order \\nto recalibrate the swing factor?  Is there any other criteria that should be consider ed? \\n91. The decision to recalibrate the swing factor should be duly justified and taken in the \\nbest interest of the investors. The revised swing factors should be the result of a robust \\ninternal governance process, in line with the LMT policy and should be based o n a \\nrobust methodology.  \\n92. Both current and new investors should be informed through the usual communication \\nchannels, such as the ordinary notice to investors, the fund’s internet website or any \\nother way as laid down in the prospectus.  \\n93. In case the swing factor adjustment goes beyond the maximum swing factor laid down \\nin the fund’s prospectus, the manager should be able to justify if required by the NCA \\non an ex-post basis the level of the swing factor applied and to provide documentary \\nevidence that such factor was at any time representative of the prevailing market \\nconditions.  \\n94. In case the fund charges performance fees, the manager should not consider the \\n“swung” NAV (i.e.: the NAV published by the manager when swing pricing is applied) \\nfor the purpose of the calculation of performance fees, but the NAV before swing \\npricing is ap plied not to take into account an over performance which is not linked to \\nthe performance of the portfolio.  \\nQ35: Do you have any comments on the proposed guidance on the calibration of \\nswing pricing?  \\n2.6.3  Dual pricing  \\nSelection  \\n95. The selection of dual pricing may be appropriate for  funds that invest mainly in assets \\nwhose liquidity costs are comprised primarily of the bid -ask spread.  Dual pricing may \\nbe less appropriate in cases of valuation uncertainty.  \\nActivation  \\n96. Managers should consider which methodology to use when activating dual pricing \\nbased on the type of the fund and the market conditions:   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\na)  calculating two NAVs (i.e.: one NAV incorporating assets’ ask prices to be paid \\nby subscribing investors and another NAV incorporating assets’ bid prices to be \\nreceived by redeeming investors); or  \\nb) setting an “adjustable spread ” around the fund’s NAV under which assets are \\npriced on a mid -market basis (i.e.: a bid price at which the fund redeems shares and \\nan offer price at which the fund issues new shares), which should be estimated in a \\nverifiable way and based on objective cri teria by the manager and could be dynamic \\nto reflect the liquidity costs in prevailing market conditions, akin to swing pricing or \\nanti-dilution levies.  \\nCalibration  \\n97. While dual pricing may be more applicable  to funds that invest mainly in assets whose \\nliquidity costs are mainly comprised of the bid -ask spread, any significant market \\nimpact or explicit transaction costs should be accounted for separately by additional \\nadjustment to the NAV.  \\nQ36: As d ual pricing is a LMT which is not particularly used in most Member States , \\nstakeholders’ feedback on the selection, activation and calibration of this LMT  is \\nespecially sought from  those jurisdictions where this is used.  \\n2.6.4  Anti-dilution levy (ADL)  \\nSelection  \\n98. By design, swing factor pricing and the ADL can be useful LMTs for funds that invest \\nmainly in assets with market -contingent liquidity costs . \\n99. As for swing pricing, managers should consider the selection and activation of ADL for \\nthose funds whose underlying assets are actively traded and information on trading \\ncosts (bid/ask) is generally available, including for funds that invest in assets with  \\nmarket contingent liquidity costs. ADL may be less appropriate in cases of valuation \\nuncertainty.  \\n100. ADL may be more appropriate for  funds:  \\na) with a high investor concentration (i.e.: a small number of investors), in order to \\naddress the risk that one investor/a few investors could fully redeem their shares at \\na short notice;   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n28 \\nb) with significant levels of subscription and/or redemption activity that could \\nnegatively impact the fund’s existing investors (e.g.: smaller funds in terms of NAV \\ncould be more impacted by the cost of liquidity caused by large redemptions);  \\nc) that invest in less liquid assets  (e.g.: high yield bonds, small cap equities) .  \\nQ37: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of ADL? Is there any other \\ncriteria that  should be consider ed? \\nActivation  \\n101. ADLs can be activated  on an ongoing basis or dynamically based on pre -defined \\nthresholds.   \\n102. In typical market environments, the ongoing activation  of the ADL primarily serves \\nas a preventative measure against dilution risks, discouraging short -term trading \\nbehaviours and protecting the interests of long -term investors.  \\n103. Managers should be proactive in their approach, recognising that market conditions \\ncan swiftly shift from normal to stressed.  While the ADL may be implemented \\nconsistently during normal periods, its calibration must be adapted to changing market \\ncondition s to ensure its effectiveness in preserving the fund's liquidity . \\nQ38: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of ADL? Is there any \\nother criteria that should be considered ? \\nCalibration  \\n104. ADL should be calibrated based on the same factors used to calibrate  swing factors. \\nThe calibration of ADL should include all estimated explicit  and expected implicit \\ntransaction costs and it should be dynamic in order to  ensure that the levy can evolve \\non a regular basis in light of the market conditions.  \\nQ39: Do you agree that ADL should be calibrated based on the same factor used to \\ncalibrate swing factors ? \\nQ40: Do you have any comments on the selection, activation and calibration of ADL? \\n2.7 Side pockets  \\nActivation    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n105. Managers should consider the activation of side pockets  only in exceptional \\ncircumstances . Exceptional circumstances can be defined as unforeseen events \\nand/or operational/regulatory environments that impact materially on the fund’s ability \\nto carry out normal business functions and activities . A non -exhaustive list include s: \\na) significant valuation uncertainty and/or illiquidity of a specific portion of the \\nportfolio of the fund for which there is no active market and/or for which trading is \\nprohibited (e.g. due to sanctions) and/or for which fair valuation is temporarily \\nunavailable with the view of segregating it from the rest of the fund (to enable this \\npart to remain open for investors);  \\nb) in case of fraud, financial crisis or war affecting a particular sector or geopolitical \\nregion and where justified having regard to the interests of the UCITS/AIF investors.  \\nQ41: Do you agree with the above definition of “exceptional circumstances”? Can \\nyou provide examples of additional exceptional circumstances, not included under \\nthe above paragraph?  \\nQ42: In your view, how the different types of side pockets (physical segregation vs. \\naccounting segregation23) should be calibrated and in which circumstances  one \\nshould be chosen over the other ? Please provide examples including on whether the \\nguidance should be different for UCITS and AIFs.  \\n106.  In order to activate side pockets, manager s should have the operational capacity \\nand governance to put in place side pockets efficiently . \\n107. Prior to the activation of a side -pocket, managers should formalise a detailed plan, \\nthat should  include elements from the non -exhaustive list provided under paragraph \\n86 of Section 6.5.5 of the draft guidelines.  \\n108. In case of activation of side pockets, investors should be made aware through a \\nformal investor communication that includes the strategy, the relevant costs, the \\nexpected timeline, contingency planning and communication to investors with regards \\nto the side pocket, as further detailed under paragraph 87 of Section 6.5.5 of the draft  \\nguidelines.  \\n     Calibration  \\n \\n23 See paragraph 89 of the ESMA CP on RTS on LMTs under AIFMD and UCITS Directive (ESMA34 -1985693317).   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n30 \\n109. Relevant  calibration for side pockets  should include : \\na) determining the activation threshold  for a side -pocket . This should also take into \\naccount legal and regulatory requirements;  \\nb) the criteria for assessing and monitoring the conditions that prompted the \\nactivation  of the side-pocke t; \\nc) determining  when the conditions referred to under paragraph b) no longer exist; \\nand \\nd) the criteria for reviewing and potentially revising the side-pocket decision and the \\nchanging circumstances that would warrant this.  \\nQ43: Do you have any comments on the calibration of side pockets ? \\n2.8 Disclosure to investors  \\n110. According to  the IOSCO guidance on ADTs LMTs, an appropriate level of \\ntransparency towards investors is important to “(i) to help investors better incorporate \\nthe liquidity cost into their investment decisions and (ii) to avoid any unintentional \\ncounter -productive effect (e.g., any trigger effects which may lead to pre -emptive \\nredemptions by investors or any actions taken by investors to game the mechanism \\nand thereby reduce the effectiveness of the anti -dilution LMTs) ”.24 To improve investors \\nawareness, t he IOSCO guidance recommends t o publish clear disclosures of the \\nobjectives and operation (including design and use) of anti -dilution LMTs.  \\n111. In this context, the FSB also recommen d that “Authorities should review existing \\ninvestor disclosure requirements and determine the degree to which additional \\ndisclosures should be provided by open -ended funds to investors regarding fund \\nliquidity risk and the availability and use of liquidity managem ent tools, proportionate \\nto the liquidity risks funds may pose from a financial stability perspective. Authorities \\nshould enhance existing investor disclosure requirements as appropriate to ensure  \\nthat the requ ired disclosures are of sufficient quality and frequency ”.25 \\n \\n24 “This is relevant both in terms of investor protection and financial stability ”. See FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management \\nTools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for Liquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment \\nSchemes (iosco.org) , p. 22.  \\n25 See Revised Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open -Ended Funds \\n(fsb.org) , p. 12.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\n112. Against this background, the proposed ESMA guidance fully endorses the IOSCO \\nrecommendations and pursu es the objective of ensuring an enhanced level of \\ninvestors’ disclosure on the use of LMTs , in line with the recommendations provided \\nat international level . Information to investors should be clear and presented in a n \\neffective manner in order to  “normalise” the use of these tools for asset managers and \\nincrease the understanding of their functioning by investors. In determining the content \\nof this disclosure, attention should be given to the exact level of detailed information  to \\nbe provided, in particular on the use of ADTs, in order to avoid the potential for \\ninvestors to engage in opportunistic behaviours, such as exploiting first-mover \\nadvantages.  \\n113. In light of Recital 55) of the revised UCITS  Directive  and 32) of the revised AIFMD, \\n“To be able to make an investment decision in line with their risk appetite and liquidity \\nneeds, investors should be informed of the conditions for the use of liquidity \\nmanagement tools ”. Furthermore, under Article 23 AIFMD (“disclosure to investors”): \\n“AIFMs shall make available to investors in accordance with the AIF rules or \\ninstruments of incorporation, the following information before they invest in the AIF, as \\nwell as  any material changes thereof: (…) (h) a description of the AIF’s liquidity risk \\nmanagement, including the redemption rights, both in normal and in exceptional \\ncircumstances, of the existing redemption arrangements with investors, and of the \\npossibility of , and conditions for, using liquidity management tools selected in \\naccordance with Article 16(2b) ”.  \\n114. Against this background, the proposed guidance recommends that m anagers \\nshould provide appropriate disclosure on the selection, calibration  and conditions for \\nactivation , deactivation   of the selected and available LMTs in the fund documentation,  \\nrules or instruments of incorporation , prospectus and /or periodic reports  (e.g. a \\nperiodic report would provide  an ex-post overview of activation whereas fund rules and \\nprospectuses would state the conditions for activating a n LMT), including  the reasons \\nfor their activation, their objectives , the implications of the various mechanisms and \\ngovernance structures around the process. The disclosure should indicate that the \\nmain purpose of LMTs is to facilitate fair treatment of investors by protecting the ones \\nthat remain invested  in the fund  from bearing the costs generated by the subscription \\nand redemption activities of other investors.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n32 \\n115. The information to investors should  help them appropriately incorporating the \\nliquidity costs into their investment decisions and to avoid any unintentional counter -\\nproductive effects, (e.g.: any trigger effects which may lead to pre -emptive redemptions \\nby investors, or any actions taken by investors to game the mechanism and thereby \\nreduce the effectiveness of LMTs)  and should be sufficient to inform them  on the \\nimplications of LMTs in terms of liquidity costs or access to their capital.  \\n116. In case of ADT s, specific guidance on disclosure is provided under paragraph 93 of \\nSection 6.5.6 of the draft guidelines.   \\n117. For redemption gates, the activation thresholds should be disclo sed in the fund’s \\nrules, offering documents or instruments of incorporation . \\n118. Periodic ex-post disclosures of a funds historical use of LMTs may be useful to help \\ninvestors: i) understand the potential cost implications of redeeming from, and \\nsubscribing to, an investment fund at different points in time, as well as the situations \\nin which they would not be able to access their capital; ii) enhance the ability of \\noversight by aut horities or other stakeholders  (e.g.: depositaries, auditors) . Managers \\nshould consider whether it could be appropriate to include such periodic disclosure in \\nthe investment fund’s annual or semi -annual financial statements or websites, and \\nwhich type of i nformation should be disclosed to inv estors at the time they submit a \\nsubscription or redemption request and after such a request has been executed.  \\n119. The type of information and the timing to disclose such information should be \\ncarefully considered to balance the benefits of providing transparency and useful \\ninformation to investors and any potential risk of unintended consequences. Disclosure \\nof detail ed calibration of LMTs and the activation thresholds may allow some investors \\nto game the mechanism to the detriment of other investors, which will circumvent the \\nobjective of LMTs  and should therefore be avoided .  \\n120. There may also be concerns that the disclosure in public reports of the actual \\nadjustment factors that have been used by funds could result in stigma effects or front -\\nrunning which may jeopardi se the effectiveness of LMTs. Disclosing a range of factors \\nthat have been used, rather than specific figures, or delayed disclosure after \\napplication, could help to mitigate this risk.  \\nQ44: Do you have any comment on the proposed guidance on disclosure to \\ninvestors ?  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n33 \\n121. Managers should provide appropriate pre-contractual disclosure to investors , in the \\nprospectus or in the offering documents,  on the possibility to activate suspension of \\nsubscriptions, repurchases and redemptions and side pockets, as the use of LMTs \\nshould be part of the description of the fund’s liquidity risk management. This is without \\nprejudice to the possibility for the manager to activate suspension of subscriptions, \\nrepurchases and redemptions and side pockets even where those are not specified in \\nthe offering documents.  \\nQ45: Do you agree that investors should be informed of the fact that the manager \\ncan activate selected and available LMTs and that this information should be \\nincluded in the fund’s rules and instruments of incorporation?  \\nQ46: Which parts of the LMT policy, if any, should be disclosed to investors?   \\n2.9 Application of the guidelines  \\n122. In light of the mandate , the guidelines shall allow adequate time for adaptation \\nbefore they apply, in particular for existing UCITS .  \\nQ47: In your view, how much time would managers need for adaptation before they \\napply the guidelines, in particular for existing funds?  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n34 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3. Annex I: Summary of questions  \\nQ1: Do you agree with the list of elements included under paragraph 17 of Section 6.5.1 of \\nthe draft guidelines that the manager should consider in the selection of LMTs? Are there any \\nother elements that should be considered?  \\nQ2: Should the distribution policy of the fund be considered in the selection of the LMTs? What \\nare the current practices in relation to the application of anti -dilution levies by third party \\ndistributors (e.g.: whether the third party corrects the price b y adding the anti -dilution levy to \\nthe fund NAV)?  \\nQ3: Do you agree that among the two minimum LMTs managers should consider the merit of \\nselecting of at least one quantitative LMT and at least one ADT, in light of the investment \\nstrategy, redemption policy and liquidity profile of the fund?  \\nQ4: Do you see merit in developing further specific guidance on the depositaries’ duties, \\nincluding on verification procedures, with regards to LMTs?  \\nQ5: Do you agree with the list of elements included under paragraph 28 of Section 6.5.2 of \\nthe draft guidelines to be included in the LMT policy? Are there any other elements that, in \\nyour view, should be included in the LMT policy?  \\nQ6: In your view, what are the elements of the LMT policy that should be disclosed to investors \\nand what are the ones that should not be disclosed? Please provide reasons for your answer.  \\nQ7: Do you agree with the above definition of “exceptional circumstances”? Can you provide \\nexamples of additional exceptional circumstances, not included under paragraph 30 of Section \\n6.5.3.1 of the draft guidelines, that would require the manager to consi der the activation of \\nsuspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions, having regard to the interests of \\nthe fund’s investors?  \\nQ8: Do you agree with the elements of the LMT plan included under paragraph 32 of Section \\n6.5.3.1 of the draft guidelines to be included in the LMT plan? Is there any other element that \\nshould be considered?  \\nQ9: Do you agree with the above list of elements to calibrate the suspensions of subscriptions, \\nrepurchases and redemptions? Is there any other element that should be considered?   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n35 \\nQ10: Do you agree with the proposed criteria for the selection of redemption gates? Is there \\nany other criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ11: What methodology should be used and which elements should be taken into account \\nwhen setting the activation threshold of redemption gates?            \\nQ12: Do you agree that the use of redemption gates should not be restricted in terms of the \\nmaximum period over which they can be used? Do you think that any differentiation should be \\nmade for funds marketed to retail investors? Please provide concrete cas es and examples in \\nyour response.  \\nQ13: What is the methodology that managers should use to calibrate the activation threshold \\nof redemption gates to ensure that the calibration is effective so that the gate can be activated \\nwhen it is needed? Do you think that activation thresholds should be calibrated based on \\nhistorical redemption requests and the results of LSTs?  \\nQ14: In order to ensure more harmonisation on the use of redemption gates, a fixed minimum \\nactivation threshold, above which managers could have the option to activate the redemption \\ngate, could be recommended. Do you think that a fixed minimum threshold w ould be \\nappropriate, or do you think that this choice should be left to the manager?  \\nQ15: If you think that a fixed minimum threshold should be recommended, do you agree that \\nfor daily dealing funds (except ETFs and MMFs) it should be set as follows:  \\na) at 5% for daily net redemptions; and  \\nb) at 10% for cumulative net redemptions received during a week?  \\nQ16: Do you agree with the proposed criteria for the selection of the extension of notice \\nperiod? Are there any other criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ17: According to the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive, the extension of notice periods \\nmeans extending the period of notice that unit -holders or shareholders must give to fund \\nmanagers, beyond a minimum period which is appropriate to the fund. In your vi ew, for RE \\nand PE funds: i) what would be an appropriate minimum notice period; and ii) would the \\nextension of notice period be an appropriate LMT to select?  \\nQ18: Do you think the length of the extension of notice periods should be proportionate to the \\nlength of the notice period of the fund? Do you think a standard/ maximum extended notice \\nperiod should be set for UCITS?  \\nQ19: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of the extension of notice period? \\nAre there any other criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ20: Do you have any comments on the guidance on the calibration of the extension of notice \\nperiods?  \\nQ21: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of redemptions in kind? Are there \\nany other criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ22: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of redemptions in kind? Are there \\nany other criteria that should be considered?   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n36 \\nQ23: Do you think that redemptions in kind should only be activated on the NAV calculation \\ndates?  \\nQ24: What are the criteria to be followed by the managers for the selection of the assets to be \\nredeemed in kind in order to ensure fair treatment of investors?  \\nQ25: How should redemptions in kind be calibrated?  \\nQ26: Do you agree that managers should consider the merit of avoiding the simultaneous \\nactivation of certain ADTs (e.g.: swing pricing and anti -dilution levies)? Please provide \\nexamples when illustrating your answer.  \\nQ27: Do you agree with the list of elements provided under paragraph 56 of Section 6.5.4 of \\nthe draft guidelines? Is there any other element that should be included in the estimated cost \\nof liquidity?  \\nQ28: Do you have any other comments on the proposed general guidance on ADTs?  \\nQ29: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of redemption fees?  Is there any \\nother criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ30: Do you have any views on how to set the activation thresholds for redemption fees?  \\nQ31: Do you have any comments the calibration of redemption fees?  \\nQ32: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of swing pricing? Is there any other \\ncriteria that should be considered?  \\nQ33: Under which circumstances should the manager consider the activation of swing pricing?  \\nQ34: Do you agree with the above principles that a manager should follow in order to \\nrecalibrate the swing factor? Is there any other criteria that should be considered?  \\nQ35: Do you have any comments on the proposed guidance on the calibration of swing \\npricing?  \\nQ36: As dual pricing is a LMT which is not particularly used in most Member States, \\nstakeholders’ feedback on the selection, activation and calibration of this LMT is especially \\nsought from those jurisdictions where this is used.  \\nQ37: Do you agree with the above criteria for the selection of ADL? Is there any other criteria \\nthat should be considered?  \\nQ38: Do you agree with the above criteria for the activation of ADL? Is there any other criteria \\nthat should be considered?  \\nQ39: Do you agree that ADL should be calibrated based on the same factor used to calibrate \\nswing factors?  \\nQ40: Do you have any comments on the selection, activation and calibration of ADL?  \\nQ41: Do you agree with the above definition of “exceptional circumstances”? Can you provide \\nexamples of additional exceptional circumstances, not included under the above paragraph?  \\nQ42: In your view, how the different types of side pockets (physical segregation vs. accounting \\nsegregation ) should be calibrated and in which circumstances one should be chosen over the  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n37 \\nother? Please provide examples including on whether the guidance should be different for \\nUCITS and AIFs.  \\nQ43: Do you have any comments on the calibration of side pockets?  \\nQ44: Do you have any comment on the proposed guidance on disclosure to investors?  \\nQ45: Do you agree that investors should be informed of the fact that the manager can activate \\nselected and available LMTs and that this information should be included in the fund’s rules \\nand instruments of incorporation?  \\nQ46: Which parts of the LMT policy, if any, should be disclosed to investors?  \\nQ47: In your view, how much time would managers need for adaptation before they apply the \\nguidelines, in particular for existing funds?  \\nQ48.

Annex II I: Cost -Benefit Analysis (CBA)  \\n1. Introduction   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n40 \\nThe revised UCITS Directive and the AIFMD establish a list of LMTs  that shall be available to \\nUCITS and AIFs. The list of LMTs and their definitions are the same in both Directives.  \\nThe Directives also  provide that, by 16 April 2025, ESMA shall develop guidelines on the \\nselection and calibration of LMTs by UCITS and AIFMs of open -ended AIFs for liquidity risk \\nmanagement and for mitigating financial stability risks. Those guidelines shall recognise that \\nthe primary responsibility for liquidity risk management remains with UCITS and the AIFM. \\nFurthermore, they shall include indications as to the circumstances in which side pockets can \\nbe activated and allow adequate time for adaptation b efore they apply, in particular for existing \\nUCITS and AIFs.  \\nThis consultation paper sets out proposals for the guidelines on  LMTs  of UCITS and AIFs .  \\nThis draft cost -benefit analysis (CBA) is qualitative by nature. Should relevant data be received \\nthrough the consultation process, ESMA will take it into account when finalising the guidelines  \\nand will include it in the CBA accompanying the final report.  \\nThe following table summarises the potential costs and benefits resulting from the \\nimplementation of the guidelines.26 \\n2. Providing guidelines on the selection, activation and calibrations of LMTs  \\nPolicy \\nobjective  To achieve a set of minimum standards by which all managers across Member \\nStates should select, activate and calibrate LMTs  \\nBaseline \\nscenario  The baseline scenario should be understood for this CBA as the application of \\nthe requirements set out in the AIFMD and UCITS Directive  without any further \\nspecification. This would leave managers complete discretion on how to select, \\nactivate and calibrate the LMTs referred to in Annex IIA  of the UCITSD and in \\nAnnex V  of the AIFMD  (hereafter “the Annexes”) . \\nTechnical \\nproposal  To provide guidelines on how managers should select, activate and calibrate \\nthe LMTs listed in the Annexes . \\nBenefit  ESMA expects that these guidelines will benefit managers, investors and \\nNCAs by providing clarity and guidance on expected practices.  \\nThe introduction of these guidelines aims at  contribut ing to the creation of a \\nlevel playing field across Member States, reducing the scope for regulatory \\n \\n26 ESG  and innovation related aspects are not of direct relevance to the specific nature of the guidelines, as well as to RTS on \\nthe characteristics of LMTs  under AIFMD and UCITS Directive.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n41 \\narbitrage, which could otherwise hamper investor protection  and financial \\nstability .27 \\nThe main benefit of the guidelines  is therefore to establish harmonised \\npractices on the selection, activation and calibration of the  LMTs listed in the \\nAnnexes. Such harmonisation will contribute to the uniformed application of \\nthe legislation by managers and to supervisory convergence between NCAs. \\nThis will ultimately  also participate to increasing investor protection and \\nfinancial stability in the EU . \\nCompliance \\ncosts  While t here is significant variation in the availability of LMTs across EU \\njurisdictions, depending on national rule s, suspension of redemptions is \\nalready available for UCITS in all jurisdictions, as shown by the mapping \\npublished in the 2020 ESMA response to the ESRB recommendation on \\nliquidity risks in investment funds28: \\n \\nFurthermore, in the majority of Member States a selection of LMTs is already \\navailable and managers are therefore already familiar with the possibility to \\nselect and activate LMTs.  \\nAs such , while having the benefit of providing a harmonised framework at EU \\nlevel for the selection, activation and calibration of LMTs, these guidelines  may \\nnot add significant costs to managers, other than compliance costs linked to \\nthe update of the relevant policies and procedures regarding LMTs. \\nFurthermore, the guidelines will not impose any strict obligations on the \\nmanagers as, ultimately, the primary responsibility for liquidity risk \\nmanagement, as well as for the selection, calibration, activation  and \\ndeactivation of LMTs is of the manager .  \\n \\n27 See FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for \\nLiquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org) , p. 22.  \\n28 See esma34 -39-1119 -report_on_the_esrb_recommendation_on_liquidity_risks_in_funds.pdf (europa.eu) , p. 36.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n42 \\n \\nQ48. Do you agree with the above -mentioned reasoning in relation to the possible costs \\nand benefits of the technical proposal  develop by ESMA as regards the policy objecting \\nof achieving a set of minimum standards by which all managers across Member States \\nshould select, activate and calibrate LMTs ? Which other types of costs or benefits \\nwould you consider in that context?  \\n3. Providing guidelines on the disclosure on the selection, activation and calibrations \\nof LMTs  \\nPolicy \\nobjective  To achieve a set of minimum standards by which all managers across Member \\nStates should provide disclosure to investors on the selection, activation and \\ncalibration of  LMTs  \\nBaseline \\nscenario  The baseline scenario should be understood for this CBA as the lack of \\ndisclosure to investors on the selection, activation and calibration of the LMTs \\nincluded in the Annexes . This would leave managers complete discretion on \\nwhether to provide disclosure to investors and on the information to be \\ndisclosed . \\nTechnical \\nproposal  To provide guidelines on disclosure to investors on the selection, activation \\nand calibration in the fund documentation, rules or instruments of \\nincorporation, prospectus and/or periodic reports, of the LMTs referred to in \\nthe Annexes , by means of endorsing the recommendations provided by \\nIOSCO and the FSB.29  \\nBenefit  The main benefit of the guidelines is to also participate to increasing not only \\ninvestor protection, but also financial stability, by means of establishing \\nharmonised disclosure standards in the fund documentation, rules or \\ninstruments of incorporation . \\nMore specifically, ESMA anticipates that the suggested approach will benefit \\nall stakeholders but particularly:  \\n- investors, by providing clarity and raising awareness on the liquidity risks and \\ncosts that they should incorporate in their investment decisions;  \\n- the overall financial system and, ultimately, financial stability, by avoiding any \\ntrigger effects which may lead to first mover advantage behaviours due to the \\n \\n29 See FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for \\nLiquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org)  and Revised Policy Recommendations to Address \\nStructural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open -Ended Funds (fsb.org) .   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n43 \\nnature of the disclosed information. This is particularly true for ADTs where the \\ndisclosure of detailed information on the activation thresholds / calibrations, as \\nhighlighted by IOSCO30, may allow some investors to engage in opportunistic \\nbehaviours to the detriment of the other investors and ultimately, of the \\nfinancial system. The benefit of providing detailed information on LMTs should \\nbe therefore counterbalanced with the potential o f such unintended \\nconsequences, which is why the proposed guidance on disclosure \\nrecommends avoiding such detailed disclosure in line with the IOSCO \\nrecommendations.  \\nLastly, more detailed and transparent information to investors would largely \\nbenefit the fund management industry from a reputational side, while reducing \\nthe stigma effect around the activation of LMTs.  \\nCompliance \\ncosts  ESMA takes the view that the proposed approach is unlikely to lead to \\nsignificant additional costs to the extent that it provides clarifications , as well \\nas a harmonised approach,  on the existing disclosure requirements applicable \\nat national level (s everal NCAs already provide for additional disclosure \\nrequirements in the fund rules / instruments of incorporation, the annual report \\nand the prospectus ). Therefore, the cost of complying with this requirement is \\nlikely to be counterbalanced by its beneficial effects , also in light of  the flexible \\napproach it allows in detailing the information to be disclosed.  \\n \\nQ49. Do you agree with the above -mentioned reasoning in relation to the possible costs \\nand benefits of the technical proposal develop by ESMA as regards the policy objecting \\nof achieving a set of minimum standards by which all managers across Member States \\nshould provide disclosure to investors on the selection, activation and calibration of \\nLMTs? Which other types of costs or benefits would you consider in that context?  \\n4. Providing guidelines on governance principles around the selection, activation and \\ncalibrations of LMTs  \\nPolicy \\nobjective  To achieve a set of minimum standards by which all managers across \\nMember States arrange their governance for the selection, activation and \\ncalibration of  LMTs  \\n \\n30 See FR15/23 Anti -dilution Liquidity Management Tools – Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for \\nLiquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes (iosco.org) , p. 22.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n44 \\nBaseline \\nscenario  The baseline scenario should be understood for this CBA as the lack of \\nminimum standards around the governance arrangements on the selection, \\nactivation and calibration of the LMTs included in the Annexes .  \\nTechnical \\nproposal  To provide guidelines on governance principles regarding the selection, \\nactivation and calibration of the LMTs referred to in the Annexes, so that the \\nselected LMTs are properly integrated and embedded in the fund’s liquidity \\nrisk management framework  of the fund . In this context, the guidelines \\nforesees the development by the manager of an LMT policy, which should \\nform part of the broader fund liquidity risk management process policy \\ndocument, and should document the conditions for the selection, activation  \\nand calibration of LMTs .  \\nThis is in line with the IOSCO recommendations.31   \\nBenefit  ESMA anticipates that the suggested approach will be beneficial for all \\nstakeholders and, particularly, for NCAs, managers and investors.  \\nThe introduction of the guidelines will standardise NCAs’ supervisory \\npractices, as NCAs will be able to request the relevant documentation on the \\nselection, activation (both ex ante  and ex post ) and calibration of LMTs and \\nbetter compare the relevant procedures and governance arrangements \\namong managers  in their supervisory activity .   \\nManagers will also benefit from the introduction of these guidelines as they \\nwill standardise the governance arrangements around the activation of LMTs \\nand will have at their disposal an LMT toolbox which will assist their liquidity \\nrisk management both un der normal and stressed market conditions in an \\neffective and efficient manner.  \\nThe guidelines  will also benefit investors by means of ensuring a transparent \\ngovernance process, as well as the right checks and balances, in the \\ndecision making around the selection, activation and calibration of LMTs.  \\nCompliance \\ncosts  ESMA expects higher initial compliance costs especially for those managers \\nwho did not have internal procedures and governance arrangements around \\nthe selection, activation and use of LMTs. However, those costs are likely to \\nbe counterbalanced by the benef its of having a governance framework that \\n \\n31 Whereby “ the internal governance arrangements should at least include the following elements: a) objective criteria (e.g.: \\nactivation thresholds) for the application of LMTs; b) methodology, including calibration; c) parties involved (e.g.: senior \\nmanagement, risk management etc); d) source of information and data used; e) controls; f) documentation of decisions made; g)  \\nescalation processes; h) oversight by the governing  body ”. Ibidem , p. 18.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n45 \\ncan effectively support the liquidity risk management of the fund and \\npromptly activate and/or calibrate, where appropriate, the selected LMTs.  \\n \\nQ50. Do you agree with the above -mentioned reasoning in relation to the possible costs \\nand benefits of the technical proposal develop by ESMA as regards the policy objecting \\nof achieving a set of minimum standards by which all managers across Member States \\narrange their governance for the selection, activation and calibration of LMTs?

\\n6.3 Purpose  \\n4. These guidelines are based on Article 16(1) of the ESMA Regulation.  \\n5. The purpose of these guidelines is to establish consistent, efficient and effective \\nsupervisory practices within the ESFS and to ensure the common, uniform and \\nconsistent application of  Union law, in particular  [Article 18a paragraph 4 of the UCITS \\nDirective] / [Article 16 paragraph 2h of the AIFMD].   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n52 \\n6. The guidelines  aim at establishing common standards in relation to the selection, \\nactivation and calibration of LMTs  to harmonise their use among Member States. The \\nguidelines also aim  at promot ing disclosure to investors and a clear governance \\nframework  around the LMTs.  \\n \\n6.4 Compliance and reporting obligations   \\n6.4.1  Status of the guidelines  \\n7. In accordance with Article 16(3) of the ESMA Regulation, NCAs must make every effort \\nto comply with these guidelines.  \\n8. Competent authorities to which these guidelines apply should comply by incorporating \\nthem into their national legal and/or supervisory frameworks as appropriate, including \\nwhere particular guidelines are directed primarily at financial market participants. In \\nthis case, competent authorities should ensure through their superv ision that financial \\nmarket participants comply with the guidelines.  \\n \\n6.4.2  Reporting requirements  \\n9. Within two months of the date of publication of the guidelines on ESMA’s website in all \\nEU official languages, competent authorities to which these guidelines apply must \\nnotify ESMA whether they (i) comply, (ii) do not comply, but intend to comply, or (iii ) do \\nnot comply and do not intend to comply with the guidelines.  \\n10. In case of non -compliance, competent authorities must also notify ESMA within two \\nmonths of the date of publication of the guidelines on ESMA’s website in all EU official \\nlanguages of their reasons for not complying with the guidelines.  \\n11. A template for notifications is available on ESMA’s website. Once the template has \\nbeen filled in, it shall be transmitted to ESMA.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n53 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6.5 Guidelines on Liquidity Management Tools (LMTs) of [UCITS] / \\n[open -ended AIFs]    \\n6.5.1  Guidelines on general  principles   \\n12. The primary responsibility for liquidity risk management, as well as for the selection, \\ncalibration, activation and deactivation of LMTs is of the manager. In the selection of \\nappropriate LMTs, managers should give due consideration that the selected tools will \\nallow to effectively manage the fund’s liquidity risk in both normal and stressed market \\nconditions and be as comprehensive as possible.  \\n13. Without prejudice to the use of tools to mitigate against the dilution of investor interests, \\nmanagers should not solely rely on LMTs to manage a fund’s liquidity risk.  LMTs \\nshould be considered as an essential element of the fund’s overall liquidity  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n54 \\nmanagement framework, which should incorporate relevant provisions related to the \\nfund’s structure, investment strategy and operational processes and procedures to \\nmanage liquidity.  \\n14. LMTs should not be seen as a backstop for the purpose of addressing liquidity issues \\nstemming from inadequate fund structuring, poor investment decisions, inappropriate \\nrisk management or other management failings.   \\n15. The activation and deactivation of LMTs should not exempt managers from their \\nobligations on best execution, eligibility of assets, fair valuation of assets, liquidity risk \\nmanagement and fair treatment of investors, as well as the obligation to ensure \\nconsistency between the investment strategy, the liquidity profile and the redemption \\npolicy of the fund.   \\n16. Manager s shall select at least two appropriate LMTs from a predefined list  (i.e.: \\nredemption gates, extension of notice periods, redemption fee, swing pricing, dual \\npricing, Anti -Dilution Levy (ADL), redemption in kind ), after assessing the suitability of \\nthose tools in relation to the pursued investment strategy, the liquidity profile and the \\nredemption policy of the fund.  Furthermore, A [UCITS that is authorised as a Money \\nMarket Fund (MMF)] / [AIFM that manages an AIF authorised as a MMF] should be \\nable to decide to select only one LMT.  \\n17. In selecting LMTs, managers should assess the suitability of those tools in relation to:  \\na) the fund’s pursued investment strategy and investment policy;  \\nb) the structure of the fund in terms of, inter alia , the duration of the notice period, \\nlock up period, settlement period and dealing frequency;  \\nc) the liquidity profile of the fund and its underlying assets, as well as the fund’s \\nliquidity demands , taking into account not only redemptions but also other potential \\nsources of liquidity risk emanating from the liability side of the fund balance sheet \\n(e.g.: margin calls) under normal and stressed market conditions, as well as the \\nresults of the Liquidity Stress Testing (LSTs);  \\nd) the fund’s redemption policy and the characteristics of its investor base;  and \\ne) the fund’s distribution policy  (e.g.: the levy to be applied by the platform) .  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n55 \\n18. While the UCITSD and AIFMD  require the selection of at least two appropriate LMTs \\nfrom the list provided in Annex V (for AIFMD) and Annex IIA (for UCITS Directive), \\nmanagers have the discretion to select more LMTs, as well as additional liquidity \\nmeasures , according to the criteria set out in the previous paragraph , in order to ensure \\nthe fund ’s overall resilience and ability to manage its liquidity during both normal and \\nstressed market conditions.  \\n19. In the selection of the two minimum mandatory LMTs, managers should consider, \\nwhere appropriate, the merit of selecting of at least one quantitative -based LMT (i.e.: \\nredemption gates, extension of notice period) and at least one ADT (i.e.: redemption \\nfees, swing pricing, dual pricing, ADL), taking into consideration the investment \\nstrategy, redemption policy and liquidity profile of the fund and the market conditions \\nunder which the LMT could be activated. In this context, managers may consider \\nwhether to se lect one LMT to use under normal market conditions and one LMT to be \\nused under stressed market conditions (for instance, one ADT to use for normal market \\nconditions and one quantitative LMT to be used under stressed market conditions).   \\n20. When considering the activation of an LMT, an assessment of whether to activate \\nLMTs individually or in combination with additional LMTs or other liquidity measures \\nshould be undertaken in each instance.  \\n21. Managers should be able to demonstrate , under the request of  the NCA , that the \\nactivation and calibration(s) of the selected LMTs is(are) in the best interest of all \\ninvestors and are appropriate and effective for the prevailing market conditions, be that \\nnormal or stressed.  \\n22. The activation of a specific LMT  or its calibration  should not in any way alter or change \\nthe fund’s investment objectives, policy, profile or characteristics as stated in the fund’s \\nrules, offering documents or instruments of incorporation . As an example, the \\nactivation of a suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions or extension \\nof notice periods should not result in the transformation of an open -ended into a closed -\\nended fund.  \\n23. When activating and calibrating LMTs, m anagers should ensure that there is no \\npossibility of modifying orders after the centrali sation date where the order will be \\nprocessed, including through cancellation requests.  Managers should ensure that the \\nlevel of subscription and redemption orders received is treated with the strictest  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n56 \\nconfidentiality , in order to avoid that some investors can benefit from information on \\nthe probability that LMTs may be activated (e.g.: activation thresholds may be reached \\nin case of redemption gates) . \\n24. Managers should calibrate and activate LMTs based on the unique attributes of the \\nfund (e.g.: the liquidity profile, the type of underlying assets, the investor base) and the \\nprevailing market conditions.  \\n25. A depositary should set up appropriate verification procedures to check that managers \\nhave in place documented procedures for LMTs.  \\n6.5.2  Guidelines on the g overnance principles  \\n26. The selected LMTs, the methodology for their calibration, as well as the conditions for \\ntheir activation, should be detailed in a documented LMT policy (“the LMT policy”) \\nwithin the fund liquidity risk management process  which should be adapted to the \\nnature, scale, complexity and liquidity profile of the fund(s) .  \\n27. The LMT policy , which should form part of the broader fund liquidity risk management \\nprocess policy document, should also document the conditions for the \\nactivation /deactivation  and calibration of the “available LMTs” . \\n28. The LMT policy should include provisions on at least the following aspects:  \\na) clear and objective criteria for the selection of LMTs;  \\nb) clear and objective criteria for the activation/deactivation of selected and \\navailable LMTs, including an “LMT playbook” highlighting the potential sequencing \\nand interdependencies of selected and available LMTs;  \\nc) the methodology for the activation and, where appropriate, deactivation of LMTs, \\nas well as the calibration of selected and available LMTs;  \\nd) the governance framework around the selection, activation, deactivation and \\ncalibration of selected and available LMTs;  \\ne) the governance framework  around the frequency of monitoring and reviewing the \\ncalibration of an activated LMT to ensure ongoing correctness and effectiveness ; \\nf) a detailed description of senior management’s role in the process, including the \\ngoverning body and the staff involved in the decision making;   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n57 \\ng) the role and oversight of internal control functions ( risk management , compliance, \\nand internal audit ); \\nh) the manage ment of  conflicts o f interests, and where such conflicts cannot be \\navoided, how their impact is managed and mitigated in the best interest of investors , \\nincluding to avoid that t he use of LMT s is aimed at  artificially increas ing/reduc ing \\nthe NAV and that  the knowledge of subscription /redemption flow s, or of other \\ninformation related to the calibration of LMTs (e.g. : ADTs’ thresholds) is used  by \\nsome investors  to benefit from more advantageous subscription or redemption \\nconditions ; \\ni) procedures to ensure  the operational readiness and effectiveness of the manager \\nand relevant stakeholders (e.g.: depositary,  accounting,  distributors and other \\nservices providers ) in the event of the activation of  LMTs  ;  \\nl) reporting and escalation procedures;  \\nm) assumptions related to the availability of data for activating and calibrating LMTs, \\ntheir justification and the frequency of their review;  \\nn) routine checks, including back testing, on the activation of LMTs;  \\no) procedures to ensure record keeping and record retention on: i) t he activation, \\ndeactivation and calibration  of LMTs  and the reasons for their activation , \\ndeactivation and calibration; and ii) the relevant data concerning the funds, \\ninvestors, historical flows, results of LSTs and market data;  \\np) procedures for effective and efficient communication to investors and other \\nstakeholders (e.g.: swing pricing factors and thresholds, and, if appropriate, the \\nexplanation of how they  mitigate the risk of first mover advantage, bearing in mind \\nthat it should be avoided that  the disclosed information  is used  by some investors  \\nto benefit from more advantageous subscription or redemption conditions , as \\nexplained under point h above ), as well as the notification process to the NCA, \\nwhere relevant.   \\n29. In case the manager has selected ADT (s) as LMTs, the LMT policy should document \\nthe nature of the costs taken into account, the rules regarding the distribution of these \\ncosts between entering, exiting or remaining holders, as well as the estimation \\nmethodology , which should be based  on documented and justifiable criteria  and  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n58 \\nreviewed at least every six months. Managers should document all methodologies and \\ncalculations in such a way as to allow traceability and ensure their logging.  \\n6.5.3  Guidelines on q uantitative -based LMTs  \\n6.5.3.1  Guidelines on suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  \\nActivation   \\n30. Managers should consider the activation of suspension of subscriptions, repurchases \\nand redemptions  only in exceptional circumstances . Exceptional circumstances can \\nbe defined as unforeseen events and/or operational/regulatory environments that \\nimpact materially on the fund’s ability to carry out normal business functions and \\nactivities  and which would temporarily prevent the manager to meet the funding \\nobligations arising from the liabilities side of the balance sheet. A non -exhaustive list \\ninclude s: asset valuation difficulties; severe liquidity issues  (e.g.: due to margin calls, \\nsignificant size withdrawal) where executing the sale of underlying as sets could cause  \\nliquidity issues for the fund (e.g.: large discounts in asset sales, large dilution of \\nremaining investors); critical cyber incident that impacts on  the fund, the manager  \\nand/or fund’s services provider capacity to operate; unforeseen market closures , \\ntrading restrictions , closure of trading venues ; severe financial and/or political crisis ; \\nidentification of significant fraud; natural disaster .  \\n31. The suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions may be applied \\ntogether with a suspension of the NAV calculation , particularly i n case of uncertain \\nvaluation  and where it is not possible to compute the NAV of the fund(s) . In other cases , \\nand whenever possible, the manager should continue to value the assets in the fund \\nand publish a NAV  to ensure a proper information to investors.  \\n32. While suspensions of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  can, in some \\ncases, anticipate the manager’s decision to liquidate the fund, as they allow time to the \\nmanager to assess whether the fund is no longer viable, managers should ensure that \\nsuspensions of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  are activated only on a \\ntemporary basis (i.e.: with the view not to permanently suspend the fund, but to re -\\nopen it , or liquidate it  or activate  a side pockets , if necessary, at a certain point in time) . \\nTo this end, prior to or immediately after the activation of t his LMT, managers should  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n59 \\nformalise  a detailed plan (the “LMT plan”) that should be in line with the LMT policy  \\nand should  include , where relevant,  elements  from the following list below : \\na) a description of the exceptional circumstances behind  the activation of the \\nsuspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions  and an analysis on \\nwhether other LMT(s) could be used/have been used under the specific \\ncircumstances;  \\nb) the possibility of the use of suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions  in combination with other LMT(s) and/or to activate other LMT(s) in \\ncase of a prolonged duration of the suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions (e.g.: side pockets);  \\nc) a tentative duration of the use of suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions and a timeline to resume normal operations (i.e.: re -open the fund for \\nsubscriptions , repurchases and redemptions);  \\nd) a simulation of the liquidity profile of the fund during the market stress and \\nfollowing the market stress (e.g.: whether some assets will have become illiquid due \\nto the market stress and/or whether the time -to-liquidation will deteriorate);  \\ne) an assessment of the suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and \\nredemptions ’ impact on investors;  \\nf) a communication plan for investors, stakeholders, service providers and NCAs to \\nnotify of the suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions , provide \\nupdates on the situation, and outline the steps being taken to address the issues at \\nhand ; \\ng) whether the suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions will also \\nentail a suspension to the calculation of the fund’s NAV and if so, the implications \\nof this;  \\nh) an exit plan from the suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions, \\nincluding re -opening procedures, determinations of timelines, costs and associated \\ncontingencies ; \\ni) an assessment of the legal and compliance risks associated with the suspension \\nof subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions , including potential legal challenges \\nor increased  regulatory scrutiny ; and   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n60 \\nl) in case  it is impossible to resume normal operations, the process to enter the fund \\ninto liquidation  or activate a side pocket . \\n     Calibration  \\n33. Relevant calibrations for the suspension of subscription s, repurchases and \\nredemptions should  include:  \\na) determining the  activation threshold for a suspension . This should also take into \\naccount , legal and regulatory requirements . Any mechanistic  approach should be \\navoided to ensure that the LMT allow s a timely intervention in order to address the \\nexceptional circumstances that prompted its activation ; \\nb) the criteria for assessing and monitoring the conditions that prompted the \\nactivation  of the suspension of subscription s, repurchases and redemptions;  \\nc) determining when the conditions referred to under para graph b) no longer exist; \\nand \\nd) the criteria for reviewing and potentially revising the decision to suspend and the \\nchange in circumstances that would warrant this.  \\n6.5.3.2  Guidelines on r edemption gates  \\n   Selection  \\n34. Managers should  consider the selection of redemption gates for all funds, as all assets \\ncould potentially become less liquid during stressed market conditions and the use of \\nthis LMT could be useful to avoid the activation of suspensions of subscriptions, \\nrepurchases and redemptions . \\n35. The selection of redemption gates:  \\na) should be considered especially by :  \\ni) manager s of funds with a strongly concentrated investor base, where a \\nredemption of a significant size could cause liquidity issues to the fund and \\naffect  investors (particularly the remaining ones);  \\nii) managers of funds whose assets might become less liquid during stressed \\nmarket conditions and/or that might take longer time to sell;   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n61 \\n[iii) AIFMs managing AIFs whose assets might be structurally illiquid/hard to \\nliquidate (e.g.: Real Estate (RE) funds and/or Private Equity (PE) funds ).] \\nb) could be less suited in case of valuation issues, in which case the manager may \\nconsider the use of other LMTs (e.g.: suspensions of subscriptions, repurchases \\nand redemptions , together with the suspension of the NAV).  \\n    Activation  \\n36. The activation of redemption gates should be considered in cases of significant  calls \\non a fund’s liquidity  and can be automatic or at the discretion of the manager when the \\nthreshold is exceeded . \\n37. For funds marketed to retail investors, redemption gates should not be systematically \\nactivated to manage the fund’s liquidity on a day -to-day basis, but should be activated \\nin specific circumstances and carefully calibrated, for instance, to address sever e \\nliquidity stresses or stressed market conditions where executing the sale of underlying \\nassets could worsen  liquidity issues for the fund .  \\n38. The activation thresholds should be disclosed in the fund’s rules, offering documents \\nor instruments of incorporation . \\nCalibration  \\n39. Managers should calibrate the activation threshold in order to ensure that it operates \\neffectively and in the best interest of investors at all times . In calibrating  such threshold, \\nmanager s should give due consideration to  the NAV calculation frequency, the \\ninvestment objective of the fund and the liquidity of the underlying assets and should \\nensure that investors are able to redeem their units or shares under normal market \\nconditions.  \\n40. The use of redemption gates should not be restricted in terms of the maximum period \\nover which they can be used (maximum duration of redemption gates), or the \\nmaximum number of times that redemption gates can be activated (maximum use of \\nredemption gates),  as long as it remains temporary in nature.  These matters should \\nbe determined by the manager on a case -by-case basis .    \\n6.5.3.3  Guidelines on the e xtension of notice periods  \\n  Selection   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n62 \\n41. As it creates a time buffer to sell the underlying assets, t he selection of extension of \\nnotice periods should be available to all funds but is recommended for funds whose \\nliquidity can deteriorate quickly in times of stress.  \\n42. In light of  the additional time that may be  needed in order to liquidate the portfolio , the \\nselection of the extension of notice periods is recommended for AIFs invested in less \\nliquid assets and, particularly, for RE and PE funds which should already have in place \\nan appropriate  notice period that is in line with the level of liquidity of their assets under \\nnormal market conditions.  \\nActivation  \\n43. The activation of extension of notice periods should be considered both under normal \\nand stressed market conditions , and it may be useful  in specific circumstances, for \\ninstance, in case of redemption pressures and/or temporary valuation uncertainty.  \\nCalibration  \\n44. In the calibration of the extension of notice periods, manager s should consider, where \\nappropriate, the time necessary for the orderly liquidat ion of  the underlying instruments  \\nin the best interest of the investors . \\n45. In order t o avoid an increase of  redemptions  requests , managers should carefully \\nconsider at what time to announce and activate the extension of notice periods .  \\n6.5.3.4  Guidelines on r edemption s in kind   \\n46.  In selecting redemptions in kind, managers should consider the applicable restrictions \\nthat apply to the use of redemptions -in-kind and its permitted application to \\nprofessional investors only, i.e. managers of funds which are marketed to both retail \\nand professional i nvestors should carefully assess the merit of selecting redemptions \\nin kind as one of the two minimum LMTs in light of their potential limited usability and \\ntheir expected impact on the fund(s) they manage.  \\n47. Redemption in kind should be activated on the NAV calculation dates at the discretion \\nof the manager , as foreseen in the fund’s prospectus/articles of incorporation . \\n48. In case of the activation of redemptions in kind, an independent third party (e.g.: the \\nfund auditor, depositary) should perform the valuation of the asset(s).   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n63 \\n6.5.4  Guidelines on Anti-Dilution Tools (ADT)  \\n49. Managers should consider the selection of ADTs for all types of funds to mitigate \\nmaterial investor dilution and potential first mover advantage. This is the case, in \\nparticular, for those funds which invest in assets that are less liquid or are usually liq uid \\nbut can become less liquid during stressed market conditions (and are therefore \\nexposed to substantial dilution risks), and for whom the liquidation cost of the \\nunderlying assets may increase significantly.  \\n50. Managers  should have appropriate internal systems, procedures and controls in place \\nat all times in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the design, \\ncalibration and use of ADTs as part of their liquidity risk management framework. \\nManagers should identify the risks specific to the selected ADTs and implement an \\nappropriate system of controls to mitigate such risks , even if such tools would not \\nalways be activated .   \\n51. When selecting and activating ADTs, managers should note that ADTs share similar \\nfeatures and may deliver similar outcomes in similar conditions.  It is to be noted that \\nunder the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive, it shall not be possible for the selection \\nof the two minimum LMTs to include only swing pricing and dual -pricing.  While t he \\nsimultaneous selection and activation of other ADTs (e.g.: swing pricing and anti -\\ndilution levies)  is not excluded under the revised AIFMD and UCITS Directive,  it could \\npotentially lead to duplicating impacts and may have the potential to undermine \\nbroader liquidity risk management objectives .   \\n52. While ADTs are generally applicable to a wide range of funds, managers should \\ndetermine the applicability of individual ADTs for a fund in both normal and stressed \\nmarket conditions.   \\n53. ADTs may have different rules around when they are activated and the thresholds for \\nactivation.  Managers should carefully assess the different levels for the activation of \\nADTs at fund level and should set appropriate and prudent activation threshold so a s \\nto avoid any material dilution impact on investors or on the fund in both normal and \\nstressed market conditions depending on the investment strategy, assets under \\nmanagement , size and portfolio characteristics (including the investment strategy and \\nasset  liquidity), estimated cost of liquidity, investor profile, liquidity profile of each fund \\nand historical  fund flows .  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n64 \\n54. The activation of ADTs may be more challenging in certain circumstances, where for \\nexample there is limited market liquidity and/or in cases of valuation uncertainty. In \\nthose case managers should consider the use of other LMTs in addition to ADTs (e.g.: \\nquantity based LMTs).  \\n55. The activation of ADTs should not affect the manager’s duty to value the fund(s) at fair \\nvalue at all times.  \\n56. Managers may activate ADTs, both under normal and stressed market conditions, to \\nimpose on subscribing and/or redeeming investors the estimated costs of liquidity. The \\nestimated cost of liquidity should:  \\na) include both explicit and implicit transaction costs of subscriptions, repurchases \\nor redemptions, including any significant market impact of asset purchases or sales. \\nExplicit transaction costs, which are generally stable in amount and quantifiable in \\nadvance of the transactions with a high level of certainty, include, but are not limited \\nto, brokerage fees, trading levies, taxes and settlement fees. Implicit transaction \\ncosts, which are costs incurred indirectly upon acquisition or disposal of assets b y \\na fund (with the bid -ask spread and market impact being the key components) may \\nvary depending on, among other things, the type of underlying asset and the market \\nconditions. A reasonable input for the estimation of the market impact could be to \\nanalyse previous transactions under similar market conditions to compare the \\ndifference between the price when the order was placed and the final executed \\nprice.  \\nb) be based, as a starting point, on costs associated with transacting a pro -rata slice \\nof all assets in the portfolio (i.e. “pro -rata approach”), unless this does not represent \\na fair estimate of the true liquidity cost. In that case, the estimation can b e adjusted \\nto reflect more accurately the expected cost of liquidity when transacting in selected \\nsingle holdings of the portfolio. Managers may consider using the pro -rata cost in \\nstressed times, when it is most relevant for mitigating the potential dilut ion impact \\non the remaining investors.  \\nc) be estimated in a documented manner and based on justifiable data and through \\nmethodologies with different degrees of sophistication to respond to the fund’s \\nprofile (e.g.: size, complexity, investment strategy, asset classes, liquidity of asset  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n65 \\nclasses, redemption condition of the fund and overall liquidity risk management \\nframework).  \\n57. As the calibration of ADTs aims at reflecting the estimated costs of liquidity, this should \\nbe adjustable when needed, even if a normal range of adjustment factors / fees is \\ndisclosed or set. To this effect, the disclosed range of adjustments should not be  \\nconsidered as a cap or restriction that would prevent ADTs from achieving their \\nobjectives to mitigate material dilution and potential first -mover advantages arising \\nfrom investor transactions. Managers should include in the fund’s rules, offering \\ndocumen ts or instruments of incorporation, as determined by local jurisdictional \\nrequirements, relevant disclosures on ADTs. These disclosures should explicitly state \\nthe ranges of liquidity cost adjustment, that these ranges could be exceeded on an \\nexceptional b asis if justified by the market conditions, the governance structures \\naround any changes and the factors driving same.  \\n58. In any case, managers should be able to demonstrate , at the request of  an NCA , that \\nthe calibration of ADTs is fair and reasonable for both normal and stressed market \\nconditions, taking into account the best interests of investors. This should be supported \\nby a strong liquidity risk management framework, which should include periodi c back -\\ntesting and strong governance.  \\n59. Managers should identify the risks specific to ADT and set up an appropriate control \\nsystem.  \\n60. Managers should not calibrate ADTs in a way that could help to artificially improve the \\nperformance of the fund.  \\n6.5.4.1  Guidelines on r edemption fee  \\nSelection  \\n61. Managers may consider the selection of redemption fees for all types of funds, but \\nredemption fees may be most applicable to  funds : \\na) that invest in assets which  have fixed/transparent/foreseeable transaction costs , \\nsuch as RE agency fees or notary fees, and / or that have low -variation transaction \\ncosts (e.g.: fixed taxes and levies on RE transactions);   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n66 \\nb) that are AIFs invested in less liquid assets where other ADTs, such as swing \\npricing, might be challenging or impossible to implement (e.g.: RE assets) due to \\ninfrequent and limited pricing sources;  \\nc) that invest in assets that have low -variation transaction costs ; and  \\nd) whose underlying assets do not have very frequent and reliable pricing sources \\navailable from various different trading venues ( as opposed to other  assets , e.g. \\nequities) . \\n  Activation  \\n62. In the activation of redemption  fees, managers may set activation thresholds that could \\nbe expressed as the size of redemption orders above which redemption fees will be \\ncharged to redeeming investors .  \\n  Calibration  \\n63. In the calibration of redemption fees, managers should apply a methodology that:  \\na) ensures the coverage of the cost of liquidity , including estimated explicit and \\nimplicit costs where applicable (e.g.: mapping what the cost of liquidity  would be \\nwithin predetermined redemption thresholds and charge those costs to the \\nredemption fee, where appropriate);  \\nb) if static, it allows  for adjustment, when required to reflect the higher cost of \\nliquidity  or stressed market conditions ; \\nc) is disclosed in the fund documentation and prospectus to ensure appropriate \\ninformation of investors.  \\n64. Managers should consider whether to calibrate the redemption fee as a single fee or \\nwhether it is adjusted based on a tiered approach corresponding to the amount of net \\nfund flows (i.e. the larger the redemption order the higher the redemption fee).  \\n6.5.4.2  Guidelines on s wing pricing  \\nSelection  \\n65. Managers should consider the selection of swing pricing for funds whose underlying \\nassets are actively traded and information on trading costs (bid/ask) is available and \\nfrequently updated, particularly where the  funds invest mainly in assets with market  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n67 \\ncontingent liquidity costs. Swing pricing may be less appropriate in cases of valuation \\nuncertainty.  \\nActivation  \\n66. The decision to activate a specific swing pricing model (i.e.: full, partial with a single or \\ntiered swing factor), as well as the calibration of the swing factor should be dynamic \\nand based on market conditions , based on a methodology that is established by the \\nmanager  and documented in the LMT policy . It should be noted that a tiered swing \\npricing system may be de facto always activated without any material effect on the \\nNAV for low levels of flows.  \\n67. The manager should disclose to investors relevant details governing the activation of \\nswing pricing both for normal and stressed market conditions . The activation threshold \\nfor swing pricing should not be disclosed in order to avoid first mover advantage.  \\nCalibration  \\n68. When calibrating swing pricing, managers should ensure that the full cost of liquidity , \\nin light of the market conditions , is incorporated  in the swing factor, including any \\nsignificant market impact of the trades. By design, swing pricing should ensure that the \\nNAV is always adjusted to market conditions.  The estimation of the liquidity costs of \\nthe assets in the portfolio should be carried out in a documented manner and on the \\nbasis of justifiable data.  \\n69. The manager should disclose to investors a maximum swing pricing factor for normal \\nmarket conditions but should also be able to  recalibrate it for stressed market \\nconditions. The possibility to recalibrate the swing factor  beyond the maximum factor  \\nin exceptional market conditions  should be established within a clearly described \\nframework and clearly  disclos ed to investors  in the prospectus.  \\n70. The decision to recalibrate the swing factor should be duly justified and taken in the \\nbest interest of the investors. The revised swing factors should be the result of a robust \\ninternal governance process, in line with the LMT policy and should be based o n a \\nrobust methodology.  \\n71. Both current and new investors should be informed through the usual communication \\nchannels, such as the ordinary notice to investors, the fund’s internet website or any \\nother way as laid down in the prospectus.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n68 \\n72. In case the swing factor adjustment goes beyond the maximum swing factor laid down \\nin the fund’s prospectus, the manager should be able to justify , if required by the NCA,  \\non an ex-post basis the level of the swing factor applied and to provide documentary \\nevidence that such factor was at any time representative of the prevailing market \\nconditions.  \\n73. In case the fund charges performance fees, the manager should not consider the \\n“swung” NAV (i.e.: the NAV published by the manager when swing pricing is applied) \\nfor the purpose of the calculation of performance fees, but the NAV before swing \\npricing is ap plied not to take into account an over performance which is not linked to \\nthe performance of the portfolio.  \\n6.5.4.3  Guidelines on d ual pricing  \\nSelection  \\n74. The selection of dual pricing may be appropriate for  funds that invest mainly in assets \\nwhose liquidity costs are comprised primarily of the bid -ask spread.  Dual pricing may \\nbe less appropriate in cases of valuation uncertainty.  \\nActivation  \\n75. Managers should consider which methodology to use when activating dual pricing \\nbased on the type of the fund and the market conditions:  \\na)  calculating two NAVs (i.e.: one NAV incorporating assets’ ask prices to be paid \\nby subscribing investors and another NAV incorporating assets’ bid prices to be \\nreceived by redeeming investors); or  \\nb) setting an “adjustable spread ” around the fund’s NAV under which assets are \\npriced on a mid -market basis (i.e.: a bid price at which the fund redeems shares and \\nan offer price at which the fund issues new shares), which should be estimated in a \\nverifiable way and based on objective cri teria by the manager and could be dynamic \\nto reflect the liquidity costs in prevailing market conditions, akin to swing pricing or \\nanti-dilution levies.  \\nCalibration  \\n76. While dual pricing may be more applicable  to funds that invest mainly in assets whose \\nliquidity costs are mainly comprised of the bid -ask spread, any significant market  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n69 \\nimpact or explicit transaction costs should be accounted for separately by additional \\nadjustment to the NAV.  \\n6.5.4.4  Guidelines on Anti-Dilution Levy (ADL)  \\nSelection  \\n77. Managers should consider the selection and activation of ADL for those funds whose \\nunderlying assets are actively traded and information on trading costs (bid/ask) is \\ngenerally available, including for funds that invest in assets with market contingent \\nliquidity costs. ADL may be less appropriate in cases of valuation uncertainty.  \\n78. ADL may be more appropriate to funds:  \\na) with a high investor concentration (i.e.: a small number of investors), in order to \\naddress the risk that one investor/a few investors could fully redeem their shares at \\na short notice;  \\nb) with significant levels of subscription and/or redemption activity that could \\nnegatively impact the fund’s existing investors (e.g.: smaller funds in terms of NAV \\ncould be more impacted by the cost of liquidity caused by large redemptions);  \\nc) that invest in less liquid assets  (e.g.: high yield bonds, small cap equities) .  \\nActivation  \\n79. ADL can be activated  on an ongoing basis or dynamically based on pre -defined \\ntriggers and thresholds.   \\n80. In typical market environments, the ongoing activation  of the ADL primarily serves as \\na preventative measure against dilution risks, discouraging short -term trading \\nbehaviours and protecting the interests of long -term investors.  \\n81. Managers should remain be proactive in their approach, recognising that market \\nconditions can swiftly shift from normal to stressed.  While the ADL may be \\nimplemented consistently during normal periods, its calibration must be adapted to \\nchanging market co nditions to ensure its effectiveness in preserving the fund's liquidity . \\nCalibration  \\n82. ADL should be calibrated based on the same factors used to calibrate  swing factors , \\ni.e.:. the calibration of ADL should include all estimated explicit  and expected implicit  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n70 \\ntransaction costs and it should be dynamic in order to ensure that the levy can evolve \\non a regular basis in light of the market conditions.  \\n6.5.5  Guidelines on s ide pockets  \\nActivation  and calibration  \\n83. Managers should consider the activation of side pockets only in exceptional \\ncircumstances . Exceptional circumstances can be defined as unforeseen events \\nand/or operational/regulatory environments that impact materially on the fund’s ability \\nto carry out normal business functions and activities . A non -exhaustive list include s: \\na) significant valuation uncertainty and/or illiquidity of a specific portion of the \\nportfolio of the fund for which there is no active market and/or for which trading is \\nprohibited (e.g. due to sanctions) and/or for which fair valuation is temporarily \\nunavailable with the view of segregating it from the rest of the fund (to enable this \\npart to remain open for investors);  \\nb) in case of fraud, financial crisis or war affecting a particular sector or geopolitical \\nregion and where justified having regard to the interests of the UCITS/AIF investors.  \\n84. In order to activate side pockets, manager s should have the operational capacity and \\ngovernance to put in place side pockets efficiently.  \\n85. Prior to the activation of a side -pocket, managers should formalise a detailed plan, that \\ninclude s elements from the non -exhaustive list below:  \\na) the governance structures around the management, operation and oversight of \\nthe side -pocket;  \\nb) considerations of the impact on investors;  \\nc) a communication plan for investors, stakeholders, service providers and national \\ncompetent authorities to notify investors of the side -pocket, provide updates on the \\nsituation, and outline the steps being taken to address the issues at hand ; \\nd) an estimate timeline detailing the proposed duration of the side -pocket ; \\ne) an assessment of the fund’s remaining assets and a determination as to whether \\nthe matter that prompted the activation of the side -pocket had any impact on their \\nquality, liquidity, valuation or viability;   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n71 \\nf) an exit plan from the side -pocket, including side -pocket termination procedures, \\ndeterminations of timelines, costs and contingencies ; \\ng) an assessment of the legal and compliance risks associated with the side -pocket, \\nincluding potential legal challenges or regulatory scrutiny ; \\nh) an assessment on how compliance with regulatory guidelines and requirements \\nrelated to side -pockets  is ensured . \\n86. In case of activation of side pockets, investors should be made aware through a formal \\ninvestor communication of:  \\na) the strategy behind establishing the side -pocket;  \\nb) the relevant  costs and  ongoing  expenses and how they will be managed ;  \\nc) how the day -to-day operations fees will be met, including when attributed liquid \\nassets are depleted;  \\nd) expected timelines to realise the inherent value of the asset(s);  \\ne) whether secondary market activities in units / shares of the side pocket will be \\nfacilitated;  \\nf) contingency plans in the event that assets cannot be realised/ timelines \\nrespected ; and  \\ng) ongoing communication after the side pocket is established .   \\n87. In the calibration of side pockets, managers should consider : \\na) determining the circumstances  for activating  a side -pocket, also in light of  legal \\nand regulatory requirements;  \\nb) setting criteria for assessing and monitoring the conditions that prompted the use \\nof the side-pocke t; \\nc) defining when such conditions no longer exist; and  \\nd) criteria for reviewing and potentially revising the side-pocket decision and the \\nchanging circumstances that would warrant this.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n72 \\n6.5.6  Guidelines on d isclosure to investors  \\n88. Managers should provide appropriate disclosure on the selection, calibration and \\nconditions for activation , deactivation  of the selected and available LMTs in the fund \\ndocumentation,  rules or instruments of incorporation , prospectus and /or periodic \\nreports  (e.g. a periodic report would provide  an ex-post overview of activation whereas \\nfund rules and prospectuses would state the conditions for activating am LMT ), \\nincluding  the reasons for their activation, their objectives , the implications of the \\nvarious mechanisms and governance structures around the process. The disclosure \\nshould indicate that the main purpose of LMTs is to facilitate fair treatment of investors \\nby protecting the ones that remain invested in the fund from bearing the costs \\ngenerated by the subscription and redemption activities of other investors.  \\n89. Managers should provide appropriate pre -contractual information to investors to help \\nthem appropriately incorporating the liquidity costs into their investment decisions and \\nto avoid any unintentional counter -productive effects, (e.g.: any trigger effects which \\nmay lead to pre -emptive redemptions by investors, or any actions taken by investors \\nto game the mechanism and thereby reduce the effectiveness of LMTs).  \\n90. Managers should provide appropriate and sufficient pre -contractual information to \\ninvestors on the implications of LMTs in terms of liquidity costs or access to their \\ncapital.  \\n91. In case of ADTs:  \\na) managers should explain clearly and in non -technical terms the reason for \\napplying the anti -dilution levy, and how that differentiates from a n exit fee; \\nb) investors  should be prepared to bear the liquidity costs associated with portfolio \\ntransactions passed on to them via the use of these tools;  \\nc) the fund documents should set out details of the constituents of the costs taken \\ninto account to calculate the adjustment factor, including the calculation or \\nestimation basis. The disclosure may also differentiate between the normal and \\nstressed market co nditions. To enable liquidity costs to be sufficiently passed on to \\ntransacting investors, the relevant funds constitutional documents should not \\nimpose the application of adjustment factors. Some funds may disclose a range of \\nadjustment factors, in par ticular those applicable under normal market conditions,  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n73 \\nto facilitate investors’ understanding of the potential implications of ADTs, with the \\naim to benefit investor communication and discourage any potential first mover \\nadvantage. When it is foreseen that the range may be exceeded, to reflect higher \\nliquidity  costs in changing market situations, this should be appropriately disclosed \\nto investors.   \\n92. For redemption gates, the activation thresholds should be disclosed in the fund \\ndocumentation, rules or instruments of incorporation, prospectus and/or periodic \\nreports the fund documentation, rules or instruments of incorporation, prospectus \\nand/or periodic reports . \\n93. Periodic ex-post disclosures of a funds historical use of LMTs may be useful to help \\ninvestors: i) understand the potential cost implications of redeeming from, and \\nsubscribing to, an investment fund at different points in time, as well as the situations \\nin which they wou ld not be able to access their capital; ii) enhance the ability of \\noversight by authorities or other stakeholders. Managers should consider whether it \\ncould be appropriate to include such periodic disclosure in the investment fund’s \\nannual or semi -annual financial statements or websites, and which type of information \\nshould be disclosed to investors at the time they submit a subscription or redemption \\nrequest and after such a request has been executed.  \\n94. The type of information and the timing to disclose such information should be carefully \\nconsidered to balance the benefits of providing transparency and useful information to \\ninvestors and any potential risk of unintended consequences. Disclosure of detail ed \\ncalibration of LMTs and the activation thresholds may allow some investors to game \\nthe mechanism to the detriment of other investors, which will circumvent the objective \\nof LMTs and should therefore be avoided.  \\n95. There may also be concerns that the disclosure in public reports of the actual \\nadjustment factors that have been used by funds could result in stigma effects or front -\\nrunning which may jeopardise the effectiveness of LMTs. Disclosing a range of factors \\nthat have been used, rather than specific figures, or delayed disclosure after \\napplication, could help to mitigate this risk.  \\n96. Managers should provide appropriate disclosure to investors on the possibility to \\nactivate suspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions and side pockets, \\nas the use of LMTs should be part of the description of the fund’s liquidity risk  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n74 \\nmanagement. This is without prejudice to the possibility for the manager to activate \\nsuspension of subscriptions, repurchases and redemptions and side pockets even \\nwhere those are not specified in the offering documents.  \\n \\n \""
